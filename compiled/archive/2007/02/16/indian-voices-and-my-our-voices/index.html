<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7129/full/445683a.html">Indian voices : Article : Nature</a><br /><br />While the scientists in India are criticised for their inaction in policy debates, it still remains a question that whether Chinese scientists really have their voices heard by the public and policy makers.&nbsp; <br /><br />The NGOs in China are not as influent as those in India, not to mention in EU and in the US.&nbsp; Therefore a scientist must seek the government if (s)he wants to be involved in the policy making process using his (her) knowledge.&nbsp; But currently I do not think scientists in China are exerting their expertise enough to influence policy making.&nbsp; The causes could be:<br/><ol><br/><li>that many researchers consider participating in policy-making kind of diversion from their research, and are not willing to do this.&nbsp; I may be well in this category, too.</li><br/><li>that researchers do not consider fully their studies' policy implications.&nbsp; China is traditionally more focused on &quot;hard&quot; science research and there is little training on proper conduct of science, and understanding of science-social relationships.</li><br/><li>that researchers do not engage non-academic groups actively.&nbsp; This is being changed in recent years, but I do not think is enough.&nbsp; This is the only common problem of China and India on this issue that I can think of.</li><br/><li>that the policy-making process is not &quot;scholar-friendly&quot;.&nbsp; This is illustrated by the hydrology engineering project in Yuanmingyuan Park taken place in 2005.&nbsp; The role of advisor is dominated by senior academics and scholar-turned-officials rather than ecologists (very few in China at the moment, I admit) who are doing actual work.</li><br/></ol><br/>The solution of the problem largely lies in the researchers' effort.&nbsp; First of all, I think both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; scientists should realise their studies' importance in terms of social effects.&nbsp; They should also reach out to the public and tell them their scientific interpretation on policies and trends (which may not be necessarily good, but people should be informed).&nbsp; Many people do not like Zuoxiu He, but I think China lacks such scientists/lobbists.<br /><br />On the other hand, the policy making process should be based on scientific evidences and principle of precautionary rather than on authorities and experiences.&nbsp; This could be too complicated for a blog entry to elaborate so I will not extend it any more.<br /><br />Thirdly, the public can form lobby groups when they feel their interests may be impaired by the policy proposed.&nbsp; There is also misbelief in science to be broken.&nbsp; The poorly educated Americans do not believe <em>in</em> science, but this indeed enables them to argue with scientists with full confidence, and sometimes they proved right.&nbsp; An open debate will bring knowledge to both sides, given it is properly moderated.<br /><br />In today's China scientists (in Chinese language context) are considered as half elite, half public, therefore I believe they can act well as the transitional layer in the elite-public interaction.&nbsp; As the voice now is mainly dominated by elite-scholars, it is more vital for other scientists and researchers to make themselves heard.</div>
