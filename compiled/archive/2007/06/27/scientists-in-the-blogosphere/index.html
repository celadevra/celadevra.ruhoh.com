This is an initiative of [Nature][1], providing a platform for scientists to write their opinions as blog entries.  It can be seen from [this page](http://network.nature.com/blogs/list).  Apparently there are already a number of researchers put their names on the Nature's list.  However, if you take a closer look, you will find that most of them has only a handful of posts.  Except for [this one](http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/U2929A0EA).<br/><br/>The causes of this gloomy appearance may include: a. established scientists are way too busy to write their blogs; b. few scientific blog writers like the templates and space provided by Nature Network; and c. there are scientific blogs out there but they are just like needles in a pile of stray that needs one to pay considerable effort to find.<br/><br/>By typing keywords "science" and "blog" into the search engine, it can be find that there is no serious and influencial blog space dedicated to the science community, which I think is a shame for both the Internet and scientists.  I do believe that blogs can be a good place for scientific information and ideas to disseminate.  While there are too many blogs which has virtually nothing meaningful on them, a scientific blog service provider may be helpful to counterbalance this trend.<br/><br/>****<br/>[1]: http://www.nature.com</div>

I like the New Scientist Blogs very much, although they are less like serious science, more like popular scientific media. Nevertheless, they are providing some interesting general background information everyday.<br>But I don&#39;t think blogs can function as effective academic communication platform, as the barriers between disciplines are distinct, it will be virtually impossible to understand each other on any serious academic topic.<br>I think there are already several mature scientific media existing, they serve quite well.<br>For a specific circle, the best method is still journal, and probably colloquium.</div>

Your words make point.  But I think scientific blogs are beneficial to both popular science hobbyists and researchers.  Publishing an article can take months and may cost considerably.  Compared to that, blogs are fast, and more accessible.<br><br>Scientific blogs will not replace journals and online publishing.  However, I think it can provide a means of sharing information and ideas more efficiently among researchers all over the world.  On the other hand, more &quot;lay&quot; people can have a better understanding of current research from such blogs.  This is a better way to approach science and scientists than reading their bio/autographies.</div>
