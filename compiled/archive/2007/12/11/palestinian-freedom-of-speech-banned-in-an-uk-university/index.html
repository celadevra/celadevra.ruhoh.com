The Palestinian Society started a protest against Israel's illegal separation of Palestinians by erecting a miniature wall, and were stopped by the police and the ``wall'' dismantled.  If you are interested to follow the link to [YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=uZLwtit8GXM), pay attention to those insightful comments.<br/><br/>I should say the police officer's reason to stop the protest at the entrance of the library is reasonable: obstruction of highway.  However his later compliment that the wall should not be erected again anywhere else seems to me unreasonable and a repression of freedom of speech.  The Pal Soc definitely have the right to continue the protest without blocking any path.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the student who was arrested by the police may be intentionally irritating the police officer, or may be just a bit too excited.  His arrest is an unfortunate result of the incident, however he should be responsible for that.<br/><br/>The real disturbing question is why would someone call the police.  A list of possible callers would be: the university, or university on someone's behalf; someone who do not like what Pal Soc did; the Pal Soc itself.  In the first case, the university will need not to seek this kind of resort, the security would be enough.  Can the security be so afraid of those students?  I don't think so.  The second, someone who do not like the protest?  Possible.  And surely they find a good reason to stop the protest.  The third case would be very unpleasant to think about, however the possibility is there.<br/><br/>Whatever the case is, the incident is telling that either the expression of legal political opinion is so unbearable to some people here in the university, or the Palestinian students are seeking ways of expression a bit more than the authority can tolerate.  Both thinking are very unsettling.  The cause of the incident can be the repression of freedom of speech enforced by the authority, or the doubt of Pal Soc on their right of freedom of speech.  Neither is desirable.  The police's command that the wall should not be erected again is wrong.  But further judgment can only be made when more details about the incident is available.  A petition is being organised in the university.  See how the response goes.<br/><br/>Before further details are present and confirmed, please do not imply that there is any racial issue involved.  The available information so far does not suggest anything like this.</div>
