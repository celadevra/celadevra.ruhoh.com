  <h1>On gaming </h1>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>I play a lot of games. Only a fraction of them I finished, even fewer that I can boast a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; completion. By that seemingly redundant expression I mean the way the developers want you to play the game: get the highest score for each stage, find all the hidden stars (or gems, passports, etc.), unlock all the weapons and achievements/trophies, and so on. Despite less and less time each week for playing, I could not stop myself from playing some games again and again, to reach that perfect status. After all, games are expensive, and you have to recognize its full value by play it in every way that is determined by its designers, right?</p>

<p>Not necessarily so. When I was young enough and carefree, time was something with little value. As time goes by, the amount of work I can do, and the extent to which I can enrich myself, increases. More and more value thus is assigned to every second of time. It is not that I find playing games a total waste of time, but the way I play must be significantly changed.</p>

<p>The idea behind the change, is that game as an art form has the ability to give you experiences that you cannot safely, or even possibly, gain by actually live them. This is just like certain types of movies, with the difference being that you can determine the flow of the story to some extent.</p>

<p>Now, the &ldquo;to some extent&rdquo; part is important. Some games are made with movies in mind, and you can only play them trigger by trigger, script by script, with absolutely no deviation from the linear unfold of pre-arranged events. Games like this dates back to interactive novels and manga, and reincarnate in the form of some of today&rsquo;s best selling games, such as Uncharted and Call of Duty franchises.</p>

<p>The other extreme is a type of game in which you are supposed to be able to do anything you like. Sometimes you are not even restricted by law or moral standards. However, games such as Grand Theft Auto sacrifices the freedom of interact with everyone for the freedom of insulting or hurting everyone. Current technology cannot create a world contained in a disc in which we can talk and befriend any random hotdog man. In GTA you can only shoot any random hotdog man, which is not very constructive or fun.</p>

<p>The first type of games is fun to play, just like some good movies are fun to watch, yet they have very little nutrient for your life experience. They are adventure stories, and adventure stories can only become legend if they exhibit human&rsquo;s best part: courage, love, faith, etc. It is not so easy as it seems to let the player feel these while also let them have fun. Some good novels and movies have managed to do this, games are yet to reach this stage, although the Halo and Uncharted franchises are pretty close now.</p>

<p>The latter type was meant to give the player the maximum freedom so they can explore the world in the game, which can be quite an experience. However, most of these games cannot materialize their claims. Only certain things are allowed in the game, and you can only make progress by doing this mission and that quest. Games of the sandbox type, if poorly executed, can be such a pain to play that you do not even want to pick it up again, such as GTA 4. But brilliant ones can become a multi-faceted experience that worth multiple play throughs, such as Red Dead Redemption. Another subtype only has the most basic rules and let you choose what to create, the prime example being Minecraft, but this characteristic make them more like authoring tools and experiment apparatuses rather than games.</p>

<p>Most games are between these extremes. They may offer different characters but largely identical stories &ndash; Borderlands and Diablo comes to mind; or they give you only one story but multiple ways to experience it &ndash; such as Mass Effect with different character builds or Ninja Gaiden with differnt weapons. For these games, I do multiple playthroughs if the difference in characters or equipment leads to a different mechanism of play or a different direction of story, or else I just play it once.</p>

<p>As for those bells and whistles, the treatment is similar. If it is just eyecandy or meaningless boast, such as &ldquo;a blade with purple glow&rdquo; or &ldquo;kill 5 enemies in a row of headshots&rdquo;, I will pass. But if it changes the way the game is played, such as awarding you boots that allows you to jump through an area instead of swimming through it, maybe I will try to get it.</p>

<p>Sounds like I am more inclined to play Nintendo games, heh.</p>

<p>Multiplayer gaming is another matter. Online experience may change. But similarly, mindlessly playing team deathmatch with a bunch of strangers can be a waste of time. If you have real-life friends who can join your clan in an online game, that would be another matter. Nothing beats having an unreal experience with real-life friends, and online gaming no doubt is a more healthy way to do that.</p>
