### Who am I?

In real life, I am a PhD in Geography, working on coordination of
international environmental protection projects.  Meanwhile, I am
writing a column on environment industry and technologies for China
Business News.  I am also responsible for the well-being of a silver
shorthair cat named Xiaohuihui.

On the Internet, I am: 

* [@celadevra](https://twitter.com/#!/celadevra)
* [@CeladEvra](http://www.weibo.com/celadevra)
* [Celad Evra@Douban](http://www.douban.com/people/celadevra/)

A blogger with commitment is supposed to use their real name, but this
can cause unnecessary troubles for a Chinese blogger, as our culture
has not been able to prepare us for peacefully accept different
opinions.  Please forgive my skin-saving cowardice.

To better put labels on me, you can also read
[10 things I believe](../ten-things-i-believe-en). 

### What is the blog about?

The short answer would be "everything about me".

But it is not necessarily right.  I am not so comfort with putting
everything about me online.  But, in the backend git repo for the
blog, there are raw ideas, half-baked articles due to lack of courage
or energy to publish, and snippets that almost nobody else have any
interest.  I may rummage the repo some other time and present you
those that can be published.  And I may grant my children, if any, the
access to the repo in the future, to let them understand parents
possibly different from who they have always known.

And you, my reader, will be able to find comments on culture and
technology phenomena both on- and offline, my introspection on my
ideas and belief, and my off-duty projects (my office job is something
that I find boring to death but have to do to keep my families fed).
In earlier entries, you can also find how a light-hearted, naive small
town teenager refused to grow up.

A successful blog is supposed to be about a very specific topic.  But
to me, blog is what
[Michel de Montaigne](http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/montaigne/m-essays_contents.html)'s
works is to him.  I do not write it to appear professional, but to
record the rapidly changing times that I happen to live in.  It is
about nothing else, but a collection of multitudes of ideas and
deeds called "me" and the marks made by the collision of "me" and the
world.
