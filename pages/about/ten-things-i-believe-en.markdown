## 10 things I currently believe

### The climate change we are experiencing is largely caused by human actions
    
### Shouting slogans and blaming the government is less useful than knowing, defending and practicing your rights as a citizen

### Few most-followed IDs on Chinese microblogs are qualified for their influence

### Life's basics should be taught in the kindergarten and knowledge in the university

### Physics is the prime example of applying principles of science, but it is by no means superior than other subjects

### Whether open or closed, well-designed software and hardware should allow people to fully use its capacity

### Animal welfare starts with empathy, but our difference from animals in the positions in the ecosystem means we cannot put our value system on their needs.

### In short term, benefits from nuclear power outweighs its health risks
    
<!--### *Sans la liberté de blâmer, il n'est point d'éloge flatteur*-->

### State intervention is necessary for the economy, classical liberalism can cause problems in reality.
