Conservation efforts must prioritise the well-being of local populations.<br/><br/>Natural populations seldom reach carrying capacity and are continually cut back by density-independent factors.<br/><br/>Organisms evolve to occupy a tightly defined niche.  Only one species occupies a niche in one place at one time.  Niche will decide the morphology of the organism.  Unrelated species occupying similar niches are driven by natural selection to evolve similar traits.</div>
