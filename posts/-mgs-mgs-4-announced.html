On E3 Expo, Hideo Kojima announced new MGS title. Which will be MGS 4. On <a href="http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs/english/index.html">the official Metal Gear Solid Site</a>, a new link pointing to <a href="http://www.konami.jp/gs/kojima_pro/index.html">&quot;Kojima Productions&quot;</a> appeared, which mentioned &quot;MGS 4&quot;, as well as a power-up version of MGS 3 (I know it would come) and Metal Gear Acid 2.  The promotion movie of new MGS also comes out at this address: <a href="//wm1.streaming.ne.jp/konami2/kojimapro_e32k5_e_n4v8.asf">mms://wm1.streaming.ne.jp/konami2/kojimapro_e32k5_e_n4v8.asf</a>  In my last blog about new MGS, I mentioned that in new MGS there will be &quot;no place for Hideo Kojima&quot;, well, forget about that. In the promo, Hideo changed it to &quot;No Replacement for Hideo Kojima&quot;. Good news? At least for MGS 4.  In the promo we can see Raiden and Snake fighting to seize the place for the &quot;main character&quot;, and of course Snake won, but maybe Raiden (or someone looks like him) will also appear in the new MGS.  I guess CQC would still play important role in new MGS, and there could be more drastic environment changing, which makes you &quot;no place to hide&quot;.  Hideo also played parody on Splinter Cell and Sam Fisher. He knows quite well  about his enemy: XBOX 360 and UBI, huh?</div>

Add up: the promo movie won E3 &quot;the Best Trailer&quot; prize. Quite unusual for a game trailer that shows very little thing about the game itself.</div>
