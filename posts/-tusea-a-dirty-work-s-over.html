The day before yesterday after 3 hours' discussion, we finished choosing this year's team members of both mountaineering and scientific exploring teams. It's fast enough. I remember that last year it took us 3 days. As before, there are people who lost the opportunity this year. To comfort them become another hard and embarrassing job.<br/><br/>However, this year there are less people qualified to be chosen. Fewer people took part in the training, even fewer completed it. So the choice is less painful.<br/><br/>The next thing to do is get down to the preparation of mountaineering and survey, full-throttle.</div>
