Right now, only three of the exploration team are left in the campus. Avalier, however and I. The rest have already get on the train to Xining. Right now they may be talking about the journey ahead. We are delayed by different causes. Therefore we are starting off tomorrow.<br/><br/>To me, this time going away is different from all times before. I am graduating this year, which means I won't come back to my dorm and see my classmates for very long time. As the time of departure draws near, the feeling becomes stronger and stronger.<br/><br/>There will always be new horizons. However, saying goodbye to something you have long had always makes one a bit sad.<br/><br/>I am in such a dilemma. I kept thinking of my teammates and I want to see them ASAP. At the same time I know that after tomorrow, I won't be a student of my university. I will become alumni.<br/><br/>I managed to tackle all matters needed for graduation this afternoon. When I finished I just feel so weird and exhausted. Well, maybe leaving the class earlier is better for me. The torment will be less.</div>
