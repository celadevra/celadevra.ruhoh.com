Just now, at the weekly meeting of the climbing club, the list of this year's mountaineering and scientific exploration team is announced.<br/><br/>This moment is always sentimental and makes one excited. Seems everyone's satisfied with the result. Now it's time to get the work begin.<br/><br/>I will need to make a more detailed question and goal list as well as make sure the topic of the survey is submitted, discussed and correctly chosen.</div>
