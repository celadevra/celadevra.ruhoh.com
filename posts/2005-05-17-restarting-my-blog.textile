This, I guess, is one of my earliest blogs. Because of the great firewall, I couldn't see what I have written after I submit. However, I managed to use some small tricks to get through that (they can't block the whole internet, can they?). So I decided that I will restart this blog.<br/><br/>My old blogs are scattering here and there:<br/><a href="http://snakehsu82.spymac.net/blog/">http://snakehsu82.spymac.net/blog/</a><a href="http://snakehsu.blogchina.com/"><br/>http://snakehsu.blogchina.com/</a><br/><a href="http://snakehsu.freefronthost.com/">http://snakehsu.freefronthost.com/</a>
