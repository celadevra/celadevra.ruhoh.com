It's May 19th, 09:02 AM, a few hours before the time when Star Wars Episode 3: the Revenge of the Sith hit theatres and cinemas all over the world.<br/><br/>This can be a very sentimental moment. When a legend which lasts over 30 years finally comes to an end, we may be a bit lost. But before I see this movie, there is more anticipitation than sadness in me.<br/><br/>Most critics speak highly of this closing episode to the Star Wars Epic. Some lucky boy who saw it last night say it's kinda na&quot;ive. No matter what they say, I want to see it myself and have my own private feeling about it.
