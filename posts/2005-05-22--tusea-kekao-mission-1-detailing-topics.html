<div class='post'>
We are applying for some fund provided by a magazine called Nanfengchuang. They want plans that are practical and results expectable. In order to achieve this, our plan has to be modified. We will need more detailed contents about our exploration.<br/><br/>There are 4 aspects around Qing-Tibet railway: society, economy, culture and ecosystem. We should choose 3 -- 4 topics from these aspects. The topics should be attracting, unique and can be completed with limited time and resources.<br/><br/>Right now I have a topic about researchers along the railway, and one about cattle-raising industry. I also asked others in the preparation team to think about some possible topics.<br/><br/>I also have to read some books about social survey because I will give a lecture to all team members about it.</div>
