Well, let me put out my hand and count with my fingers: my graduation thesis, my optional course essay, the science exploration preparation work, visa application.... I don't really know if I am busier than the time when I was a Junior student. But I am very sure that I can manage my time better than then.<br/><br/>The most important issue is that I like what I am doing. My experience in these months may bring me benefit in the rest of my life. One who is not so busy may never understand how he can do so many things at the same time. I hope one day I will become a scientist who is important in the science world. That would mean much work and a life fulfilled. So, how can I be beaten by these work at my hands now?<br/><br/>Some of my classmates simply do what they are asked to do. Well, I will do that part at least as well as them. Besides, I will carry out my duty, which they never have, from which they never take any pleasure.
