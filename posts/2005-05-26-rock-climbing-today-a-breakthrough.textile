Today I finally managed to top the required rock climbing route, which means I have formally got the right to go to the expedition this summer vacation. This year's route is a bit harder than that of last years. I invested a lot of time practising. I am not so good at rockclimbing. However, I progress a little every time. Yesterday I tried 5 or 6 times but I didn't figure out how to reach the last step of the route. At last I understood but I was too exhausted to climb. Today is the test. I thought over the route last night. The whole process is very smooth. When climbing, I almost forget everything else, only the rock wall and I exist. At last when I reached the bar at the top of the rock wall, I heard claps and joyful shouts from below. I was so happy then. I have got good luck. It also have something to do with my practice.
