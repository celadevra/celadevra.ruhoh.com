My friend and I just come back from the movie. We all know well about the plot. Anakin Skywalker will finally become a Sith. The value of Star Wars Episode 3 is that it tells us the struggle of Anakin and the real intrigue of Darth Sidious, so the Epic can be complete.  George Lucas must tried very hard to make the plot between Episode 3 and 4 smooth. In RotS we can see the former types of star destroyer, tie fighter and X-wing, as well as storm troopers.  These all can bring any Star Wars fan a sentimental feeling. For one thing, our memories of olddies SF movies are brought back. For another thing, the age of Star Wars is gone. Maybe Lucas will betray his words and shoot another Star Wars movie, but it won't have much connection to the old ones.  The movie is a exciting journey from the beginning. There are only a few slow tempo scene. They are necessary to show us how deep Anakin's love to Padme is. Still, the emotion of roles is abrupt and thin. We don't want to critisize that, because it's not the key point of the movie.  The ending of Episode 3 can be among the best endings of movies. The scene in Tatooine is the best I have ever seen.</div>
