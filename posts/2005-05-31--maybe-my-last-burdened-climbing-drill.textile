It's June 1st, Children's day. Also, it's near the end of our intensive training for this year's mountaineering. Today, the subject is climbing training, ascend for 500 metres with a burden of 40kg.<br/><br/>I never thought it a over-heavy burden. But I worry about our fatigue. I and VstarLoss decided that we wouldn't climb too fast. It took us 84 minutes to complete the training.<br/><br/>After the training, first I just feel relaxed. Later when we headed to the dining hall, I remembered that this could be the last burdened climbing drill in our climbing club. Suddenly a sentimental and bittersweet feeling stroke me.<br/><br/>No more &quot;Cheer up&quot;s, no more encouraging cries! How long it would take for me to reunion with my teammates under the tall tower? Ade, bricks; ade, my friends!<br/><br/>But all of them are so happy! There are years to come before they leave the club. Everyone's enjoying themselves while enduring the hardest labour. This summer, some of them will be going to Nyanqen Tanglha Mountain. God bless them!<br/><br/>The sky's especially blue today, which makes me happy.
