A proposed framework for developing indicators of ecosystem health<br/><br/>This article from SpringerLink give a few principles you must consider when you are assessing regional ecosystem health.<br/>
<ol>   <li>
Because you are considering health, you should always consider factors concerning human health and well being in the ecosystem;
</li>   <li>
Biogeochemical and socialeconomic factors are influencing each other;
</li>   <li>
Different management goals determined different indicators used;
</li> </ol>
A holistic approach to ecosystem health assessment using fish population characteristics<br/><br/>This article provided an idea that using some key species as the indicator of region ecosystem health. However, I think it is difficult to apply this method to Fengtai and Fangshan district in my research. I know too little about species and biodiversity in this area and lack knowledge of historical data in this area.<br/>Nor can I identify a key species.
