Last night the exploration team had its first gathering. We again introduced ourselves to the team. Various jobs are assigned respectively to team members.<br/><br/>Later we had a small running drill. After that endboxer, wenmang and I had a discussion on the practise of the exploration.<br/><br/>As we have decided before, this year's new survey will not be like before. We will not just ask the same questions to everyone and get some meaningless statistic data. What we want is the *fact*. Firstly, we will limit our goal to a very small matter, then we will ask different people concerning this matter. They have different stands and views, so at last we can have a complex view of this matter and understand it better. This is like depth investigation in journalism. You can refer to <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com">National Geographic</a> to get an idea of this kind of survey.<br/><br/>The final report will not only include survey result in a formal format, but also detailed stories about the object we discussed.</div>
