In order to make all team members mobilised, we will ask them to do some literature searching and write a review or report on what they find and read.<br/><br/>Now we have 4 subjects, one group (led by endboxer) will search literature focusing on economy, especially on stock raising, the second group (led by wenmang) will try to find reports on Tibet stock farmer's situation, the third group will be led by me, and will focus on education, science and culture. Two people will also need to find more backgrounds of the railway.<br/><br/>In the next phase, we will have a second time grouping, which will be based on the research topics we choose.<br/><br/>And in the exploration, members of different groups will be mixed in order that when they go to different samples, all questions concerning all 3 subjects can be asked and recorded.<br/><br/>Today after the group is formed, I will ask members of different groups do these things: find literature, try to raise new ideas about the researching topics, make a plan about who should be visited and by what means can we do the investigation.</div>
