The topic of the report: the history, variation and challenges of Tibet culture.<br/><br/>The topic of research: don't have good ideas yet. The topic must be about the relationship between railway (traffic) and culture. Maybe I shall read some articles about this relationship.<br/><br/>Doing search, I find that term "culture" is a word that covers too vast while contains very abstract concept.<br/><br/>To measure the impact that brought to Tibet culture by railway, I think a way is to talk with those railway workers, mainly Tibetan workers, some Han workers as a complement. A better way is to talk to teachers and their pupils, then try to identify change in their concept and opinions.</div>
