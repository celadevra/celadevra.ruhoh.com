On the net there are some versions of <a href="http://media.ps3.ign.com/media/714/714044/img_2792482.html">new MGS 4 poster</a>. From the poster we can see eight characters. According to <a href="http://www.ign.com/">IGN.com</a>, most of them are almost surely returning characters such as Vamp, Meryl and Ocelot. Some characters' identities remain mystic. There are characters looks like Big Boss, Naomi Hunter and Raiden, we just don't know whether they are really who they are supposed to be, nor how they play their part in new MGS.<br/><br/>From the poster we can see other elements. The circles with a short stick indicating direction may refer to soldiers in CQB or something else. Some concepts of Metal Gear Acid may also be used in MGS 4, just like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Final Fantasy XII.</div>
