The progress of the preparation seems to be going in a spiral path. The same questions are discussed again and again. Each time we finished discussion about an old question we always have new ideas and solve problems that are ignored before.<br/><br/>Today the situation is similar. Again we talked about how to choose research topics and make everyone in the team participate in the academic work. We find that we all have some different ideas with the other two. We tried to make ourselves clear and the method of our research seems now more clear too. In Beijing, after we decided the research topic, team members will be asked to prepare questions from different subjects' view. When in Tibet, several team members who are good at organising interviews will lead other members to different interviewees' place and ask questions from their particular aspect (economic, culture, ecology, etc.).<br/><br/>In this case, the consistence and continuance of interview record is especially important. In my opinion, when preparing the final report, all recorded materials should be organised by research topics and different subjects. This should be discussed.<br/><br/>Translators could be problem. We need at least three of them to complete interviews in limited time. However, this is not very difficult problem, I think.
