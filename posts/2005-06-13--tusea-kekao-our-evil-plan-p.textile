We are now collecting topics from team members. However, we have in fact decided our main research topics. Tomorrow we will discuss about how to reject all these topics except the two we chose.<br/><br/>Well, the fact is that our team members all submitted their ideas without thinking over the schedule and difficulties in the exploration. Many topics are not practical or too complex. Therefore our only choice is to terminate them and stop our teammates from throwing too much energy in them. I know this sounds like devil's chicanery. You think for yourself.<br/><br/>We asked team members to submit their ideas so that they can take more active parts in the exploration. This idea is simply great. But next time we may need to do this work earlier, e.g. before the list is decided.<br/><br/>Tomorrow we will have further discussion on the choice of the topic and persuasion of team members. In the evening I may face very hot debate. I also need to make more detailed interview plan for the two topics decided.
