It again took us over three hours to discuss about the arrangement of interview. Our main consideration is that we should make every member of the team active in the whole exploration, so we have to let them think of research topics themselves. But, if everyone think over his topic, there will be no one working for other people's topic.<br/><br/>The solution is as follows: team members are grouped by different interview places (interviewees);  all team members are required to write an article from a specified aspect which is not told until the end of the exploration. So they would do their best to collect materials for his article and share them with others. The leader of the project would notice what topic is necessary and assign them to team members. All team members can write some proses on anything they find interesting.<br/><br/>In the evening suantou reminded us that we should let the team fellows do more jobs and think more, which I think, is what we are fighting for.</div>
