Today I give team members another task: find articles on four aspects; try to know more about the project before we set off. I hope everyone be willing enough to pay their efforts to the research.<br/><br/>Wednesday, we will make sure if our suits are fit.<br/><br/>Friday, final check before the scouts set off. Last discussion (maybe) before the journey starts.<br/><br/>Sunday, last time preparation meeting.<br/><br/>And on next Monday we will be going to Tibet!</div>
