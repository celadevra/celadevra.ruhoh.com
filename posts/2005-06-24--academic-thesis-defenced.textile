Yesterday I managed to defence my thesis, which means my four year undergraduate study is drawing to an end. The day before I had a road test. Fortunately, I found a lot of problems in the pretest, which I paid a lot of attention in the formal defence.<br/><br/>LaTeX Beamer is still the most convenient and automatic slide maker. Though there are a few .ppts looking better than my beamer slide, I believe that I paid far less time in this.<br/><br/>My presentation was fluent. Teachers didn't raise any challenging question. I am sure that I will get a score above 85.<br/><br/>However, my thesis has some format problems and I have to modify it.
