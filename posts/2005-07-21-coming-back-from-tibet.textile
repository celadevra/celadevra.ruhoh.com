Again I am in hot, humid Beijing. Again I am busy preparing visa application. The journey to Tibet may just mean little to me now. However, allowed some time, it may finally become one essential part in my life. I can't deny that in this very journey I decided that I will go on climbing. The Seven Summits? The 14 8000ms? They are not that far as before.<br/><br/>My blog in blog-city.com is to be deleted. Let it be. To make one good blog is enough.<br/><br/>The University of Edinburgh just give me offer today. Too late, geez, or I will surely accept it without any hesitate.
