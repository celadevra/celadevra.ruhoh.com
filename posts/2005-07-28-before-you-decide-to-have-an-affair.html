Yesterday Palo invited Vstarloss and I to a dinner. After that when we walk back we talked about celibate. Vstarloss says he may one day give up this. But Palo says that he won't as long as there is something for him to do. One won't feel alone when he's doing something he thinks interest.<br/><br/>I think Palo's words make sense. You have to invest a lot of time when you are in an affair. If you have something else to do, especially when you are interested in that, the time you invested in love affairs will make you feel painful.<br/><br/>I have to stop here because my friends are calling me for a dinner.<br/>Continue next time.</div>
