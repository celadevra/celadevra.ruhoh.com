And if you think you have met the companion of your life, it is worthy to drop the things you are doing to be his/her company. They are special because if you don't pay enough attention to them you will never complete yourself and you will lose them.<br/><br/>But how do we identify such particular person from other people? We may feel happy when we are with someone. But it's not enough, yet. You feel safe, easy and at peace when you are with such person. You know without them you will not be complete. Do remember this is different from the feeling that you don't want to leave them.
