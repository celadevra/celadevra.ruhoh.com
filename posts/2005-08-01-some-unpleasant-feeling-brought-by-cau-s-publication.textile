On the roof top we haven't got much to read. Today I picked up a magazine edited by China Agriculture University's mountaineering team. It has a lot of articles. Most are about their May day holiday.<br/><br/>They went to Mount Sigu'niang (the Four Ladies) in Sichuan province and Xiaowutai Mountain in Hebei province. A female team member who went to Sigu'niang described her experience of falling on a snow slope and (I guess) hypothermia. She talked with no sign of fear or regret.<br/><br/>There is also an interview to their most experienced team member, called Asan. Asan was asked if he is afraid about death. But he just said death is nothing special. He even asked: &quot;who should be afraid of death?&quot; Geez, I don't want to climb any mountain with such daredevil. As one who has climbed a few snow mountains he should know there are something to fear.<br/><br/>The principle of CAU, famed Professor Chen Zhangliang is very supportive to the mountaineering team. But I think this has some negative effects to their development. They may get too aggressive. In the magazine they even mentioned that next year they will begin preparing for climbing Mt. Everest. This could be very dangerous for a team established in 2003 and lack experienced climber.
