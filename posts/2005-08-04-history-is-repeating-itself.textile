Today I read an article in a magazine called Nanfang News Weekly. It is a comment on the founder of blogchina.com, Fang Xindong. The article mentioned how Fang decided to start blogchina.<br/><br/>A few Years ago Fang wrote several articles on Micro<span class="math">oft's monopolization over the OS market. Micro</math>oft's media department was powerful enough to control many portal websites and they deleted Fang's post at once. Fang was very angry and he began to look for a media that can't be controlled by large firms like MS. Then he found blog and started blogchina.com.<br/><br/>About 3 years later, I also find that my blog entry concerning censorship is deleted on blogchina.com, so I abandoned that blog and started this one. Today when I read this I feel history is tragically repeating itself. blogchina.com now is also a tool of censorship and filtering.
