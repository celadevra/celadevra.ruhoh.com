Things that I already know are omitted.<br/><br/>Ecology is a science concerning how nature worked. Environmentalism is just a concern. The environmentalists' idea may be drawn on scientific data, but also may be based on emotional appeal or on ethical or moral criteria. There are environmental science, too, which studies the influence of human actions on natural processes.<br/><br/>Natural selection is the mechanism that determines which lineage leaves the most descendents. At the same time it is the loss of all members from a population other than those with optimal genotypes. Those lineages with traits best biological programmed will have better chance to leave more descendents. The parents are successful in this therefore new generation too different from the parents may not be so successful. Natural selection, contrast to people's assumption, don't encourage mutant but heredity.<br/><br/>In Further Readings, maybe I can find Grand(2000).<br/>See http://www.prenhall.com/bush for relating online resources.
