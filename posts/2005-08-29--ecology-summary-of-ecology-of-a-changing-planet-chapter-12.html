Open-ocean productivity is generally less than 100 g C/m^2/year, but upwellings and continental shelf areas may be two to three times as productive.<br/><br/>Coral reefs are closed nutrient systems that maintain high rates of productivity under oligotrophic conditions.  Under eutrophic conditions they may be outcompeted by other organisms like algae and zooplanktons.<br/><br/>Water bodies can be vertically thermally stratified into epilimnion, thermocline and hypolimnion.<br/><br/>Old lakes are lost through geological factors and hydrarch succession, and new lakes are formed by glaciers, rivers, chemical dissolution, and volcano activity.<br/><br/>Different communities of aquatic life will be found according to the nutrient levels and temperature and oxygen profiles of lakes.</div>
