[Ecology] Summary of 'Ecology of a Changing Planet', Chapter 3<br/><br/>Biodiversity is assessed at the landscape, species, population and genetic level.  The strongest pattern in biodiversity is a decline in species diversity from equator to pole.  This may be due to history: first angiosperms originated in tropical regions, productivity, habitat structure, stronger specialisation.<br/><br/>Most species are relatively rare with small to moderate geographic ranges, but are locally common where conditions are optimal.  A common species is not "better", or even better adapted than a rare species.<br/><br/>Conserving biodiversity is tightly tied to conserving tropical ecosystems.<br/><br/>[Ecology] Summary of 'Ecology of a Changing Planet', Chapter 4<br/><br/>The greatest variable in tropical climate is precipitation caused by the migration of the intertropical convergence zone and Hadley cells.<br/><br/>[Ecology] Summary of 'Ecology of a Changing Planet', Chapter 5<br/><br/>An ecosystem includes both biotic and abiotic processes of a region.  All ecosystems are affected by those that surround them.  Small ecosystems are nested in larger ecosystems.<br/><br/>Most nutrient uptake by plants is from the upper 3cm of the soil.<br/><br/>The speed of nutrient cycling lies at the heart of agricultural and forest productivity.  Temperature, moisture and soil conditions decide the speed of nutrient cycling.<br/><br/>Ecosystem functions are the natural services that the ecosystem provides to neighbouring ecosystems and to the organisms that live within it.  Ecosystem values are the uses, or worth, that humans ascribe to an ecosystem.<br/><br/>[Ecology] Summary of 'Ecology of a Changing Planet', Chapter 6<br/><br/>Every organism needs energy for successful reproduction.<br/><br/>C4 plants have a more powerful chemical pump to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  C4 can gain enough CO2 in less time than C3 plants, hence it's more suitable for dry, hot conditions.<br/><br/>Either using CH2O to generate energy or build the plant body needs oxygen equal to generated in photosynthesis.  Therefore, it's a common fallacy that we will asphyxiate if we get rid of all green plants.  In fact without plant we will starve before asphyxiate.<br/><br/>If pasture is to be maintained in a healthy state for domestic cattle, the exploitation efficiency should not exceed 30% to 45%.</div>
