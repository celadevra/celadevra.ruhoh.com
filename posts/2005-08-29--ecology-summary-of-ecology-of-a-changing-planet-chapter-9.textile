Natural selection determines that all predators are coward; the brave go extinct.<br/><br/>Predators forage optimally by expending the least amount of energy necessary to achieve fitness and will switch prey items if necessary.<br/><br/>Predator avoidance is the best defence against predation.<br/><br/>Predation can be an important factor in the maintenance of biodiversity because it prevents competition exclusion.<br/><br/>When explaining Batesian mimicry, the author gives the example of eastern tiger swallowtail. It is usually yellow. But when poisonous pipevine swallowtails are abundant, the female eastern tiger swallowtails mimic them. Is the gene of eastern tiger swallowtails determine that they change their look when adequate? How is this mechanism evolved?
