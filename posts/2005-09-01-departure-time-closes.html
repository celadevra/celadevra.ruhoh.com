This afternoon I finally got the unconditional offer from <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">the University of Nottingham</a>.  Another uncertainty is eliminated.  Next, I must begin packaging.<br/><br/>My father and mother invited some of their friends to dinner today.  I do not like being with them because I have not seen them for at least 8 years.  How can I be easy with such strange fellows?  However, there is a girl going to take college entrance examination next year, so I tried to give her some advice.  Only after I got home I found that her father gave me 1000 yuan as a present.  Gee, too polite.<br/><br/>I find a web community focused on book/movie/music appreciation and comment, named <a href="http://www.douban.com/">douban</a>.  Looking good.  Maybe I can contribute something to it.  Also I start to pay some attention to writing <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> entries.<br/><br/>Maybe I invested too much time on surfing the net.  I find myself not like reading recently.  There should be self-control and change of lifestyle.</div>
