A few hours later, I will be on the flight to Munich, then go to London.<br/><br/>Just now when I was going to have dinner, an idea poped up in my mind. To many people I saw last night, it could be their last sight of me. I may not come back till 4 to 5 years later, then many of their will also leave this university even this city. It would be difficult to get together again.<br/><br/>Anyway, you cannot always stay at a same place. Everything is changing. Only with departing, gathering is meaningful. Let me just consider this departure as the beginning of next time's reunion.<br/><br/>Tomorrow would be a little hard. I will get to London at Beijing time 3:15 AM then I have to catch a bus to Nottingham.
