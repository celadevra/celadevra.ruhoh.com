I arrived in London at Heathrow Airport at 19:06, September 20th, local time. The first thing I need to do -- passing the custom -- taught me what is British custom. That is queuing. All passengers from my flight all lined up, waiting for being certified to enter the country. After I got out the airport, it's already 20:15. The left-side traffic outside in the street is very confusing. Luckily I managed to get to National Express' ticket office in one piece. Then to my disappointment, the next coach to Nottingham will go at 22:35, that means when I get to Nott It will be late midnight. 1:30 AM, I am at Broadmarsh Bus Stop, Nottingham. There were a few Asian-look people around. I caught up with two of them. They are second year here, Malaysians. We shared a cab and I arrived in Broadgate Park. But the reception told me that I couldn't move in till 24th? 2:30 AM, with the reception's help I come to Cripps hall. They find me a room. It's small but nice. At 3 in the morning I can finally put myself in bed. Wait, it's 10 in Beijing! I don't think I will have jet lag any more. I just wanted a sound sleep.
