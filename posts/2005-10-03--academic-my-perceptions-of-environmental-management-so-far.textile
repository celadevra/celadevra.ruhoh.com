<div class='post'>
The definition of Environmental Management is difficult to<br/>give. Because it is too wide and still evolving. Basically,<br/>it is about discover or forecast environmental problems and<br/>use political, economic or ethic methods as well as<br/>scientific theory and practise to solve them, in order to<br/>avoid environmental impacts brought along by projects or<br/>other human activities and improve human well-being.<br/><br/>EM aspect means stewardship, multidisciplinary, practising.<br/>It is based on broad-view, long term and gap-free (if<br/>possible) monitoring. Because environment and social<br/>continuously changes, EM should be flexible, adaptive and<br/>perceptive.<br/><br/>The means that EM usually uses to modify ethics towards a<br/>more pro-environmental way are:<br/><br/>- Advisory<br/><br/>- Economic or fiscal<br/><br/>- Regulatory<br/><br/>For EM, most of the times there are no enough time waiting<br/>for solid proofs. Modelling, simulation and forecasts are<br/>very often used in EM practise.<br/><br/>Don't forget that the ultimate pursuance of EM is to avoid<br/>environmental impact instead of merely manage a project or<br/>tackle with certain environment problem.
