I spent most of the time today in reading books on my reading list. Unfortunately, I found two of them really boring. One is "Environmental Ethics", the language in the book is just confusing and very fragged. Or, it maybe because I read that book in the cafe instead of a quieter place. However, I think it is very poorly written.<br/><br/>Another book, written by my school's professor, on my favourite subject -- ecology, is also a miserable work. I didn't know anyone who can write a book on plant ecology in such dull way. What I saw in this book is just lists of Latin names of plants, not a bit of the relationship, interaction or energy/info flow between them and the environment. The way he teaches is not very good, either. Gee, but I think I still need to stick on. For my scientific interest.</div>
