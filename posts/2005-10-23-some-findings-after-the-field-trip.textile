I just come back from a field trip organised by the school of geography. It is not very tiring physically, but you really get a lot of information and much to think about.<br/><br/>It is about conservation. The conservation of the whole landscape, both natural and cultural. You should consider local agencies, farmers, tourists, ecosystems and so on. Perfect conservation satisfying everyone may not exist but one that makes more satisfied may be better.<br/><br/>The Peak District is formed both by nature and human activities. It is representing a different concept of National Park. From very early on, the landscape there is changed and managed by man. Therefore you cannot just put things you think natural there. You must conserve human management style in that area.<br/><br/>The purpose of your conservation should be make the park sustainable in providing interested features and opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment. Human factors should be considered when making plans.
