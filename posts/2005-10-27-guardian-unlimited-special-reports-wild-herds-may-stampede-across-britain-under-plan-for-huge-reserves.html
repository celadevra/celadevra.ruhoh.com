This piece of news can be considered as (1) the sign of a more integrated European conservation framework and (2) a more aggresive step of UK agriculture reform and re-wild of its land.<br/><br/>Most of the land involved in this proposal is land with marginally farming economic value. Therefore it should not pose threat to the country's crop yield. However, there are still people living on the land. The future reserve area will not allow premanent accommodation (the statement here is not clear yet). Therefore some people will need to move. If they choose to continue farming, this could influence other farmers at their immigration destination.<br/><br/>Some new species will be able to enter UK after they extincted in this country due to human activities. Thanks to transbound conservation scheme. However, it remains questioned that whether these species would threat local landscape and species. After all, they have vanished in the wild for up to 800 years, and much of UK landscape is formed in recent 300 years.<br/><br/>Another problem may be the former use of land in the to-be reserves. Is it contaminated? Or too close to human settlements? An EIA should be carried out not only for local farming ecosystem and settlement, but also for the species coming in.<br/><br/>On politics, this proposal will help UK establish a more ecology-active nation image. No doubt that other EU countries will praise and imitate this action. At least this is good for those species which will enter UK.</div>
