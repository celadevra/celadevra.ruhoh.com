Today I had my first Center of English Language Education (CELE, DO NOT PRONOUNCE IT, please!) course. I found it very useful. Unfortunately, that means I have to modify most of my essays, even change them foundamentally.<br/><br/>The marker/reader of your essay will judge your work from such aspects: relevance; understanding of the problem; evidence of reading; critical analysis of reading; awareness of differences of opinion between sources; ability to interpret and synthesis sources; ability to evaluate different views/solutions/etc.; ability to provide support in the form of examples, data, etc.<br/><br/>When doing reading, you should note down the sources, read critically and note your own responses, try to adapt your ideas as you go on.<br/><br/>Before writing, it is very important that you analyse the given question, make sure you know what does the assignment ask you to do. Bear in mind that all that you read should be relevant to the problem.<br/><br/>When writing, first write the body draft, then introduction and conclusion. Again, all the sections should be relevant to the title.<br/><br/>After finished writing, check if all text build towards conclusion; check if the discussion is sufficient; check if you have referred to all the sources; check if you followed the convention of layout. Do a few times of proofread to make sure you have correct content, language and grammar. Focus on one problem in one proofreading session.</div>
