On wednesday I had a talk with my tutor, Prof. Roy Haines-Young. The talk was mainly about 3 topics: information flood, choosing topics for my dissertation and future career.<br/><br/>About information flood, there do not seem to be many handy solutions, a diary and a year planner is still the best choice.<br/><br/>The choice of topic for my dissertation, can be linked to conservation group's ongoing activities. I can write them letter to see if they have any problems need my help as an Environmental Management student. They seldom present their problems on the web or publications, but it is said that their will be many job vacancies. Of course, many students want to link their dissertation with such actural projects, so I may need my tutor's help when writing applications.<br/><br/>About my further study and work, it is said that my career prospect is very bright. People with understanding of both Oriental and Western culture and environmental expertise will be of great need in the near future because China is developing rapidly and many foreign companies hoping to enter China market would need such people to deal with environmental concerns.</div>
