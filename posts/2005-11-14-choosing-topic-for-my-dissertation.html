Though it is half a year away, but I should make more preparation. Besides, this may help my application.<br/><br/>Now there are three options.<br/><br/>1. Find a local conservation group and see what I can do for them.<br/><br/>2. Join Operation Wallacea's expedition, to remote countries and get data, then finish my dissertation. Some fund raising is necessary.<br/><br/>3. Work with UKCIP, it is related to climate change and could help my application and further study.<br/><br/>I am seeking information on them. But I have to be fast if I am really going to work on climate change.</div>
