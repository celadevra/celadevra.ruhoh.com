Yesterday I talked with Prof. Michael D. Steven, who is working on Climage Change in School of Geography. He told me that there is little I can do in a three-month dissertation on climate change, which is too complex and require long timescale research. On the ecosystem response, it is always changing and a lot of anthropogenic impacts other than climate change are influencing it. Thus it is very hard too.<br/><br/>He suggested that I can do something on air pollution, which is relatively easy and cheap to study. Or, urban warm-island, but that would require a car and I need to do the monitoring in the midnight.... Another option is to take part in his experiment on carbon dioxide. Seems among the three the last one is the most possible to succeed.<br/><br/>I need other information to decide what problem I should study in my dissertation.
