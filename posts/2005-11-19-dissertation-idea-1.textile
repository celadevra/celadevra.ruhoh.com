Organic Farm vs. Conventional (inorganic) farm.<br/><br/>The first thought is to compare their productivity and biodiversity, but, if you search &quot;Organic Farming&quot; with Google, you will get an article at the second rank on this topic. Therefore if I want to be original, I have to choose another topic.<br/><br/>Another title I can think of now is organic farm vs. conventional farm in carbon dioxide consolidation and emission. But this will need a comprehensive understanding of farming processes on both types of farm. To make it simple, maybe I shouldn't consider the crops on farm because their fate is too complex. Maybe I shall focus on the process on these farms. Again, data sources would be a big problem, because I don't have time to collect data for a whole year.

Still too broad.... And if you consider the crops in the field, the problem will become extremely complex. It is possible to consider different farming practices and the influence in carbon dioxide emission.<br><br>Or, if we consider the net yield as consolidated carbon, it is easier to compare those between organic/conventional farming, and emission from farming machinery, decay of residual materials and fertiliser.
