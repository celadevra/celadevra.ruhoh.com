Only some very vague ideas so far. It is about invasive species.<br/><br/>It is known that in Peak District there are some species are under the threat of alien species. For example water vole predated by mink. An article discussed the possibility to predict invasion by niche analysis.<br/><br/>Or, it is possible to look to the trees planted by forestry sectors, see how they affect local moorland or bog.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I will go to check out the list of invasive species in UK. See what I can do on this.
