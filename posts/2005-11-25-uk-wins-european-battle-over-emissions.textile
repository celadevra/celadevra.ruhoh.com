But lose the battle against CO2 emission technically....<br/><br/>This is an example of how EC, ECJ and UK interact in the implementation of emission quota scheme and trade system. In order to make the policy success to most countries, ECJ agreed that the UK claim for increasing quota is necessary.<br/><br/>Hope this trade between ECJ and UK would ultimately bring the environment something good...better enforced quota system, for example.
