Today is the opening day of the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention.<br/><br/>It could be a "historical event" because it is the first meeting of Parties to UNFCCC after Kyoto Protocal enter into force in February this year. However, the importance of the conference depends on its outcome. The attitudes of the US and 'big' developing countries, such as China, could well determine the result of this conference. A constructive result would be a better enforced reduction target than Kyoto, or the solution to debates between developed countries and LDCs. However, both of them would be too difficult to achieve before next protocol after Kyoto. It is helpful if they can proceed one step toward that in this conference.<br/><br/>Dispute is unavoidable. Some countries have already raised the problem of payback for conservation of rainforests in the first day's discussion. The problem is how we face and tackle with disputes. It is impossible to satisfy everyone. Compromising to everyone is not necessarily beneficial to all parties. It is ideal if all countries can consider holistically for the whole earth and mankind. Unfortunately, it is national interest often put before those.<br/><br/><strong>Richard Kinley, Officer-in-Charge,UNFCCC</strong> states that:<br/>"2005 has emerged as a remarkable year for international climate change policy. The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February opened a new phase in international efforts to protect the global climate. The first ever meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol will open shortly, marking a formal start of work under the treaty."<br/><br/>Yes, but 2005 also saw the sign of end of fossil fuel, two horrible hurricanes, drought and flood all over the world. It could be too important if nothing is really done in this conference -- end of normal climate.</div>
