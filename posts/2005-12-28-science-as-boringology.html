The word "boringology" is coined by journalists of UK popular science magazine New Scientist.  The point they want to make here is that observations or researches that seem to be boring can acturally be very meaningful and exciting.  Science, and many other crafts that demand devotedness are all similar in this.  You can really feel bored if you are not paying your effort in it!  The pleasure from science lies in questioning, pondering and discovering.</div>
