Today I read an article by Dan Bloomfield et al., titled &quot;Deliberative and Inclusionary Processes: Their Contribution to Environmental Governance&quot;. I only have the draft version of this paper, however, the knowledge and skills shown in this paper made it one of the best papers I have read. I read it non-stop until I finished this 33-page long article.<br/><br/>Deliberative democracy and decision-making is a very complex field of research. Bloomfield et al. definitely have a thorough and deep understanding of such issue. The article discussed from various aspects of the problem. It raised many questions worth thinking, or never raised before. What makes this article more precious is the huge amount of information provided. The whole article has few words that are dispensable. To absorb this article better, four to five days may be appropriate.
