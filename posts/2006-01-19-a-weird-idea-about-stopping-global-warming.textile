According to last week's Nature Podcast, planting trees to stop global warming is not a good idea. First it is too slow. Second and more important, carbon will finally be released as these tree die, and global warming will accelarate this. Third, plants release methane, which has more Global Warming Potential.<br/><br/>I come up with an idea when I was reading a book printed on recycled paper. Why not just plant trees and cut down them and make paper? They will absorb CO2 anyway, and carbon in the form of paper is seldom released. If making paper is polluting, well, we can still use wood to make furniture and structures.... Sounds like we are going back to Medieval Ages.<br/><br/>Laugh as you wish, I know it is absurd. But I am sure someone else much more famous than me will raise this proposal when there are no other ways to reverse climate change.
