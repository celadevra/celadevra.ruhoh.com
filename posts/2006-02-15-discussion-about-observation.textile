Though just finished exam and did not really begin to read all those stuff, Kerry provided some quite interesting ideas. She will go on to search for more cases and see if there are more approaches on data interpretation.<br/><br/>The PhD proposal for Notts has to be submitted tomorrow or I will miss scholarship application. Though it is not a satisfying one I have to finalise it.<br/><br/>Other issues are moving smoothly. Though, I feel drowsy in the afternoon and evening when I was reading books. Perhaps it is because spring is coming....
