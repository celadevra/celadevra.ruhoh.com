Luckily, the framework for the previous topic can largely be used in this topic.<br/><br/>But now I begin to doubt the suitability of WhyWhere model. How well can it simulate the distribution of Sphagnums? I will need the result for defining initial distribution and habitat preference. If it is not accurate enough, I will need a distribution map and various habitat parameters.<br/><br/>Besides, how do fire and overgrazing influence habitat characters and to what extent? How I change the parameters in the model? These remain questions and will need a lot of reading and thinking.
