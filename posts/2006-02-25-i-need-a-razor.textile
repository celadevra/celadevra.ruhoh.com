Yesterday we tutorial group had another session with the tutor. Before that I thought I made a plan that would work. But the tutor said it was still too complex. There are too many indicators to consider for a 3-month research.<br/><br/>Therefore I am going to look for a means to get habitat preference score using fewer indicator and maybe from aerial photographs.<br/><br/>I had a trail run of WhyWhere model this morning. Using vegetation data and coordinates from Google Earth, the model found 9 datasets in the area. Finally the model gave a model with only one variable: elevation. This may make some sense as it influence water table. For a small area like Dark Peak, other variables may not change too much. I will try to verify this in my trip.<br/><br/>But does it really know what species I am studying?
