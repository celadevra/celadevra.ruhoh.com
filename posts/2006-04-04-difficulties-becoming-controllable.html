Next Monday I will obtain data from Moors for the future partnership.  Hopefully I can extract possible Sphagnum patches from the IR images.  However, I haven't used the software (MapInfo) before, nor do I know how to use the data across several GIS platforms that I may use.<br/><br/>Only after I get DEM will I be able to simulate soil moisture using MODFLOW.  A good news is that I found it possible to use DEM directly in MODFLOW.  The article is on GRASS' homepage.  I may need to contact the author to get details.<br/><br/>What made me worry is the safety and feasibility to validate Sphagnum patches in summer.  Those patches may be far from any footpath.  I need to ask Jack how to work safely on those bogs.</div>
