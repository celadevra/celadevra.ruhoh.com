Today I went into a seminar by mistake and did not leave in time. So I had to just sit through it. The speech was given by a professional from Devonshire County Council. He said he worked for Military Intelligence, which is a bit scaring. He discussed things to consider during incidents that require evacuation:<br/>
<ul><li>
Evacuate from what?
</li><li>
Why evacuate? (Is there any alternative?)<br/>
</li><li>
Evacuate who?
</li><li>
When to evacuate?
</li><li>
Evacuate to where?
</li><li>
How to evacuate?<br/>
</li></ul> 
He talked about some new or ignored technology to deal with these questions. Including barcode on the skin and RFIDs. Maybe implants as well? The key thing is collecting information about the incident and people involved, then present the information adequately to the decision-maker, rescurer and people in the field. There may be some implications for GIS application. However, the situation is too complex and too rapid changing for today's GIS systems to handle in real time. Of course, GIS research about landscape information, connectivity and other spatial-temporal relationships can help understanding possible situations and making evacuation plans.
