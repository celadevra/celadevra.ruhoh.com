He spoke highly of my proposal. Anyway, I spent much time on that and now it is close to the deadline, thus I guess it should be good enough.<br/><br/>However, he pointed out that the biggest problem, again, is too broad question(s). I need to submit a more specific research question in this proposal. Maybe I shall focus on only one aspect of habitat preference. Hydrology? Maybe.<br/><br/>I'll do more searches on sphagnum propagation then find out what is the _key_ factor.
