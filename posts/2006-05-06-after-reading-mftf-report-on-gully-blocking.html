I found that my original hydrology model may not be using an appropriate scale.&nbsp; It was too coarse.&nbsp; Luckily, I think finer scale will only make the simulation longer and occupy more CPU time, nothing more.<br/><br/>Gully blocking will raise water table in and near the gullies.&nbsp; This can be modelled by defineing gully areas as with permenant water table in summer.&nbsp; But I think in winter there is no water even in blocked gullies (according to my observation in early March).&nbsp; This remains a question....<br/><br/>If I find modelling the whole area in a spatial-explicit way too exhausting, I may use a simplified model -- just see what are the hydrological conditions within a certain range from a gully, and use gully locations to get a estimation of hydrology for that area.</div>
