On the base of yesterday&#39;s trial, today I reduced the model area to Bleaklow only.&nbsp; Surrounding areas are defined as inactive cells and holes in DTM are filled with elevation data from OS map.&nbsp; The simulation now still cannot converge but the water budget gives good consistency (inconsistency&nbsp;about 0.01%).&nbsp; The map of water head draw down and dry cells also make sense.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The&nbsp;question now I have is why the water table draw down so fast&nbsp;in just&nbsp;one day.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would also&nbsp;like to&nbsp;know the storage coefficient of water in the soil --&nbsp;absence of this parameter may lead to what I see in the simulation.&nbsp; Maybe I should ask the authors of MODFLOW whether such rapid draw down is normal and if I ignored something in the simulation.</div>
