Yesterday I decided to simplify the hydrology model which is used to determine habitat suitability, because I noticed that water table changes in and below the 3rd layer are meaningless in the model. Thus I made a new one similar to the original one but with only 3 layers. The 1st layer defined as peat layer and is unconfined; the 2nd defined as mineral soil, confined/unconfined with variable transmissivity; the 3rd defined as a receiver of water.<br/><br/>A simulation of 7 days shows that new model has less discrepancy than the old one.  After I extended the simulated time to 900 days the discrepancy is even smaller, maybe due to more stable storage of water.  The waterhead drawdown shows that most Sphagnum patches I found in field survey have smaller drawdown (&lt; 1m).  This result is useful because it can help improve remote sensing classification.
