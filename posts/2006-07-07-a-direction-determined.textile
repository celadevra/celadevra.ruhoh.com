After I transformed the waterhead drawdown graph, the classification result and the locations of known Sphagnum to ArcGIS raster format and combined them in one map, I am glad to find that there _is_ good agreement between waterhead drawdown, vegetation type and Sphagnum distribution.  Most Sphagnum patches are located in cells defined as &quot;not dry&quot;.  However, I cannot tell what is the exact line between &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;not dry&quot;.<br/><br/>The absence of Sphagnum gives poorer result, I guess this is because I did not find some patches in the areas, but Sphagnum can in fact establish in some of them.<br/><br/>Next, I need to find out the width of Sphagnum habitat in terms of hydrology conditions.  Then I can do remote sensing prediction for data of both 2003 and 2005, then determine the trend and the usability of GRASP model.
