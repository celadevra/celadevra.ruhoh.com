My last field trip seems to be a success overall.  I have proved the link between signatures, waterhead and Sphagnum presence.  Thus I can determine from remote sensing images the locations of Sphagnum patches.  Actually I just finished marking those patches on a ArcGIS  map today.<br/><br/>Next, I will do the same to the 2003 data so they can be used to validate the model.  On the other hand, I need more understanding of the GRASP model and R software package.  This will occupy most of my time in the following period.<br/><br/>I heard from one of my group fellows during my undergraduate dissertation that they are going to publish a paper based on my dissertation on a journal.  That will be my first published work.  Very exciting indeed.</div>
