I tried to use GRASPeR to predict presence today.  The problem encountered is that when I use "Model" operation from the GUI, R (mgcv library) gives error message saying that the number of "knots" exceeds the maximum allowed value.  It hints that I can get round this either by increasing maximum knots number using<br/><pre>gam.control</pre><br/>, or by changing the smoother to other types instead of the default thin plate, using<br/><pre>s</pre><br/>function in<br/><pre>gam</pre><br/>command.  However, I found that with GRASPeR I cannot change these values.  It seems that GRASPeR defined these values as default but I cannot find where to modify them.The documentation of GRASPeR gives only usage of GUI and functions provided by it.  No troubleshooting section, no file format description, no description of dependency.  I am really mad about it.I downloaded the source code of GRASPeR, see if I can get round my problem by modifying the source and recompile.  If not, I will have to use some more primitive methods, such as typying command one by one by myself</div>
