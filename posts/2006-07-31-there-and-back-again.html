The GRASPeR simulation result is not very satisfying, the model can only explain about 30% of the variance.  R2 is also not good.  I do not know if this is an acceptable result and have to ask my supervisor.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think CAPS can use actual map aside from randomly generated map.  Thus I am considering turn back to CAPS again.  To define habitat types and their suitability I need to find out what are the key variables determining <i>Sphagnum</i> suitability.  This involves using cluster analysis and scoring of values.  I'll do that tomorrow.</div>
