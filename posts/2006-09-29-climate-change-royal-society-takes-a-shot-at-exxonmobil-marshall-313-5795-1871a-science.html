I wonder if my Environmental Business teachers see this article.<br/><br/>In fact, what ExxonMobil did is not an environmental crime in traditional sense.  As itself claims, it had programme to reduce CO2 emission, as well as funding researches on global warming issues.  All it did is claiming that the evidence of greenhouse gas (GHG) induced global warming is not solid in its report, which is contrary to scientific consensus.  At the very least this is not ``political right''.  To examine more deeply, corporate citizenship requires organisations adapt to information they receive.  ExxonMobil is really ignoring the information that most scientists and governments acknowledge that GHG is enhancing global warming significantly.<br/><br/>Besides, ExxonMobil this time neglects its duty as an educator.  It is the organisation's responsibility to educate its employees and managers, as well as up- and down-stream partners about good and evil. Stating such irresponsible opinion in their report, they surely did something not so good.<br/><br/>Uncertainties?  There may be.  But ExxonMobil seems forget something called Precautionary Principle.  Saying that GHG-led global warming lacks statistical proof gives people an impression that GHG emission reduction is not a pressing and crucial issue, which is a drawback from Montreal and Kyoto.</div>
