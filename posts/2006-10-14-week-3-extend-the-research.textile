I have read some articles on 20th Century's Tibetan pastoralism. From these materials I can write a note on the system, including climate factors, policy, changes and problems. The time span covered so far is from 1950s to present day, with very little description of past pastoralism before 20th Century. My supervisors suggest that I look for diaries and notes written by explorers in late 19th and early 20th Century, because perhaps I can find some descriptions and have a more thorough understanding of the evolution of Tibetan pastoralism through the Century. On the other hand, pastoralism in a wider geographical area, including Nepal and Central Asia, may provide another perspective on Tibetan pastoralism. But this would need more extensive search and reading. I have some knowledge gaps including ethnography and politics, which I will need to see to later, but more literature review may also help filling these gaps.
