在办公室干活10小时（好吧，包括发呆和开小差的时间）后，收拾东西要出门时看到墙上有人贴了这份``Lord of the Rings: An allegory of the PhD?''，读完后大笑三声。原来我们和 hobbits 是这么相像啊。以后谁要读 PhD 我一定送套 LotR 小说给他（她）。<br/><br/>本想翻译全文，无奈没有时间，不然明天咖啡的开销要翻倍了，就偷懒只贴英文全文：<br/><h4>Lord of the Rings: an allegory of the PhD?</h4><br/>The story starts with Frodo: a young hobbit, quite bright, a bit  dissatisfied with what he's learnt so far and with his mates back  home who just seem to want to get jobs and settle down and drink  beer. He's also very much in awe of his tutor and mentor, the very  senior professor Gandalf, so when Gandalf suggests he take on a  short project for him (carrying the Ring to Rivendell), he agrees.<br/><br/>Frodo very quickly encounters the shadowy forces of fear and despair  which will haunt the rest of his journey and leave permanent scars on  his psyche, but he also makes some useful friends. In particular, he  spends an evening down the pub with Aragorn, who has been wandering  the world for many years as Gandalf's postdoc and becomes his adviser  when Gandalf isn't around.<br/><br/>After Frodo has completed his first project, Gandalf (along with head  of department Elrond) proposes that the work should be extended. He  assembles a large research group, including visiting students Gimli  and Legolas, the foreign postdoc Boromir, and several of Frodo's own  friends from his undergraduate days. Frodo agrees to tackle this  larger project, though he has mixed feelings about it. ("'I will take  the Ring', he said, 'although I do not know the way.'")<br/><br/>Very rapidly, things go wrong. First, Gandalf disappears and has no  more interaction with Frodo until everything is over. (Frodo assumes  his supervisor is dead: in fact, he's simply found a more interesting  topic and is working on that instead.) At his first international  conference in Lorien, Frodo is cross-questioned terrifyingly by  Galadriel, and betrayed by Boromir, who is anxious to get the credit  for the work himself. Frodo cuts himself off from the rest of his  team: from now on, he will only discuss his work with Sam, an old  friend who doesn't really understand what it's all about, but in any  case is prepared to give Frodo credit for being rather cleverer than  he is. Then he sets out towards Mordor.<br/><br/>The last and darkest period of Frodo's journey clearly represents the  writing-up stage, as he struggles towards Mount Doom (submission),  finding his burden growing heavier and heavier yet more and more a  part of himself; more and more terrified of failure; plagued by the  figure of Gollum, the student who carried the Ring before him but  never wrote up and still hangs around as a burnt-out, jealous shadow;  talking less and less even to Sam. When he submits the Ring to the  fire, it is in desperate confusion rather than with confidence, and  for a while the world seems empty.<br/><br/>Eventually it is over: the Ring is gone, everyone congratulates him,  and for a few days he can convince himself that his troubles are  over. But there is one more obstacle to overcome: months later, back  in the Shire, he must confront the external examiner Saruman, an old  enemy of Gandalf, who seeks to humiliate and destroy his rival's  protege. With the help of his friends and colleagues, Frodo passes  through this ordeal, but discovers at the end that victory has no  value left for him. While his friends return to settling down and  finding jobs and starting families, Frodo remains in limbo; finally,  along with Gandalf, Elrond and many others, he joins the brain drain  across the Western ocean to the new land beyond.<br/><br/>[And they lived happily ever after?]<br/><br/>这篇 blog 链接的网页似乎是原作者的，上面写了他这篇奇文的来由。有兴趣的可以顺路去看看。</div>
