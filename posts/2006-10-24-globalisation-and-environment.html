This is a lecture given by Andrew Dobson from Keele University.  The argument of Andrew's is that environment, which is generally looked on as a casualty of globalisation, can be used as a weapon of (more equal) globalisation.  Today's globalisation, led by G-7 countries, are asymmetrical globalisation.  Instead of ``diffusion'' of people, technology and finance, it is ``transfusion'', i.e. things are flowing in only one direction.  Environmental issues and arguments, he claims, helps globalisation in another way round, and can help achieve a more equal globalisation.  The argument is quite convincing.  However, my opinion is that environment can also serve today's globalisation in favour of a few countries' local interests.  Consider Green Trade Barriers and Pollution outsourcing, these activities are responses to national environmental problems in a globalisation context.  Is it necessary then, to stop such shameful practices and accept environment degradation, or sit back and watch environment degradation in other countries?  Thus, to make environment a weapon to facilitate more globalisation, a framework of international law and enforcement is a necessary condition.  Without this framework, the developed countries may still acknowledge their environment debt to developing countries and lower class but their actions will not be dependable.  The subtitle of the seminar is ``Environmental languages in a global grammar''.  My question would be how weaker voices in the world express themselves in this grammar.  The argument still looks like from a Western perspective.</div>
