Time goes past really quickly.<br /><br />I guess searching for articles for 12 hours per day is a bit too much.  Besides, if I do not start writing I may never finish it.  Therefore I just changed my strategy, write an outline first, then look for the relevant materials, one section per day.  <br /><br />Even so, all this work combined with reading assignments of other training programs is intimidating.  I find it hard to keep critical on the materials I am reading after a long day of such activity.  Fortunately, I am still progressing.  I have already had a grip on Tibet's holocene climate.  The next thing is the climate at present.  Considering the diversity of climate types in Tibet, there is also considerable work load.  But this will make a important base for my review and thesis.<br /><br />I do not know how much time I have on this part, but I think I must be patient in next few weeks.
