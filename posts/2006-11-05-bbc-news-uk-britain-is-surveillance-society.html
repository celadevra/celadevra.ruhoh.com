<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6108496.stm">BBC NEWS | UK | Britain is 'surveillance society'</a><br /><br />Thanks to /. which reminds me of this cruel fact: that I may have about 300 appearances on CCTV cameras per day.&nbsp; UK is among the countries with most surveillance and privacy worst protected.&nbsp; What is worse is that my keystrokes during working may well be recorded.&nbsp; I would not blame my university without evidence but the fact that I am using pre-installed Windoze system on that machine is somewhat worrying.<br /><br />This does not mean the US becomes a more lovely country.&nbsp; It is not and never has been.&nbsp; As the surveillance in the US is implemented by multiple agencies it can be more complicated and more powerful.&nbsp; What is sure is that people are being terrorised so they accept total control anyway.<br /><br /><dl><dd><em>Remember, remember, the 5th of November</em></dd><dd><em>The Gunpowder Treason and plot;</em></dd><dd><em>I know of no reason why Gunpowder Treason</em></dd><dd><em>Should ever be forgot.</em></dd></dl></div>

1605年11月5日，Guy Fawkes 图谋爆破英国议会大厦并谋杀英国国王。阴谋失败后被绞死。这段情节后来在《V》里面有反映。在两方立场上都可以解释这首诗。因为当天正好是11月5日，所以添了这个。</div>
