<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6153104.stm">BBC NEWS | UK | World Cup site threat to swallows</a><br /><br />This is an interesting environmental management case.&nbsp; It is special in that it involves international affairs.&nbsp; Bird migration may be the link of friendship between countries -- as well as of disputes.&nbsp; In my memory there is no international law regulating bird conservation.&nbsp; Swallows are not rare or endangered species (yet).&nbsp; The question now is, should South African pay the bill for the conservation of a bird which is liked by Britons?<br /><br />In South Africa Environmental Impact Assessment is mandatory for almost every construction project<sup>[1]</sup>.&nbsp; Why EIA did not address such a threat to over 3 million swallows currently nested in the future site of World Cup matches?&nbsp; My guess is that the public did not consider the swallows important; the local authority would not pay for &quot;British swallows&quot; either.&nbsp; Apparently there is no pressure group claiming the interest of swallows.&nbsp; When choosing site for such project, it is the competition of interest groups determining the final choice.<br /><br />Now there is RSPB standing out for the interest of swallows (perhaps Briton's as well).&nbsp; How much weight can they put on the South African official's decision?&nbsp; I noticed that South Africa is one of the 53 Commonwealth countries.&nbsp; Does this organisation play its role on environmental issues?&nbsp; Maybe time can tell.<br /><br />(Strange, RSPB has not put out this issue on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/">their website</a> when I write this post.)<br /><br /><hr width="100%" size="2" />[1] Environmental Impact Assessment in Thailand, South Africa, Malaysia and Denmark: working report. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruc.dk/upload/application/pdf/9c4d310e/workingpaper1.pdf">http://www.ruc.dk/upload/application/pdf/9c4d310e/workingpaper1.pdf</a></div>
