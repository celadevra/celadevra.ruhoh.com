The review on Tibetan environment is close to finish.  The climate section is the most detailed.  The other are less so.  Given the availability of today's literatures on Tibet biomes and geology, I believe to write a more detailed version for the other parts will cost much more time than the current one.  Another problem is that considerable amount of data are only accessible from China.<br /><br />I surely have more literature reviews to do in next weeks.  However, I also realised that it may be the time I began preparation for the fieldwork.  Some work may take longer than I expect, so an early start would be better.  I have not talked about this with my supervisors, but I think they will agree with me on this.<br /><br />During the study of Tibetan ecology I find the system more complicated than I previously estimated.  The dynamics of pikas is complicated enough.  This may add some difficulties to future research, considering it is basically blank in ecological research in Tibet.
