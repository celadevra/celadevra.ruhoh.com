After handing in my review to my supervisor, I suddenly feel very tired.&nbsp; So tired that I virtually did nothing on this Friday, nor today.&nbsp; I think it is time now to look back and see what I have done in the past weeks.<br /><br />The first review is good in that it covers many essential aspects, though not necessarily deep.&nbsp; Based on that, the second review on environment tries to find more about ecosystem components and their interactions.&nbsp; However, I find literature I read all focusing on certain topics: Holocene climate, alpine steppe, etc.&nbsp; Apparently a comprehensive review of Tibetan nature is still absent.<br /><br />The Second review thus cannot be considered as good enough, though I myself cannot easily tell what is wrong.&nbsp; Perhaps I should return to it from time to time and write down what is relevant to my research area.&nbsp; The next review would be on Tibetan history, especially pastoral history.&nbsp; It would not be as easy as writing a chronology because there will be contrast of ideas, even ideologies.<br /><br />During my searching I find that many people in academic world criticise transforming nomadism to sedentary pastoralism.&nbsp; Then what is the originality of my research?&nbsp; Perhaps a different geographical setting?&nbsp; Or perhaps I can reach a conclusion rather different?&nbsp; Maybe it will be original in a way that I do not expect.</div>
