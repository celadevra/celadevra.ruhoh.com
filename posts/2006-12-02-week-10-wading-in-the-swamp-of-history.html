This week's theme seems not appealing to me.&nbsp; Almost all western researchers are blahing the seizure of Tibet but almost none of them deal seriously with the history in the feudal age of Tibet.&nbsp; One particular interesting question is the origin of the Tibetan nomadism -- whether it is evolved from sedentary agriculture populations in the south of Tibet or from other nomads in Central Asia?<br /><br />I have a lot to talk to my supervisor so I am expecting a lengthened meeting on Monday.&nbsp; Hope my busy supervisors do not get away after the first hour.</div>
