This week's theme seems not appealing to me.  Almost all western researchers are blahing the seizure of Tibet but almost none of them deal seriously with the history in the feudal age of Tibet.  One particular interesting question is the origin of the Tibetan nomadism -- whether it is evolved from sedentary agriculture populations in the south of Tibet or from other nomads in Central Asia?<br /><br />I have a lot to talk to my supervisor so I am expecting a lengthened meeting on Monday.  Hope my busy supervisors do not get away after the first hour.
