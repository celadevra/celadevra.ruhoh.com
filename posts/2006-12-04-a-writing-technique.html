This is what today's training course is mainly about: 5 minutes' free writing for every day.&nbsp; To do this you do not need any outline or detailed plan, just a topic for each day's writing.&nbsp; The idea is to write non-stoply for 5 minutes without considering spelling, grammar or even if the sentences are saying anything meaningful.&nbsp; Just write anything you think of the topic at the moment in your mind.<br /><br />I find this kind of writing a bit demanding at first, because you have to think about one particular topic and sentences for 5 minutes.&nbsp; But in this 5 minutes I identified some ideas that I would not come up with otherwise, as well as knowledge that I did not know myself know.&nbsp; In this sense free writing is useful to tell what we already know when we get stuck in writing an essay.&nbsp; Another commonly used tools such as mind maps can tell us the gaps in our knowledge.&nbsp; Therefore I think it would be very useful if we can combine these two techniques and use them iteratively when writing.</div>
