Just some ideas my supervisor come up when I asked her about time factors of my fieldwork.<br /><br />Considering I am going to have 1 summer and 2 winter visits to the area, I need to take action early next year.  After Christmas my review will shift focus from background to methodology.  Then in March or April I will do a &quot;reconnaissance&quot; visit, mainly for establishing contact and know the field better.  In July and August I will do the summer fieldwork.  This would mean I will write my proposals and 1st year report in the field in very traditional ways -- pen and paper.  On the other hand, this means I will need to determine a range of things such as site choosing, logistic, interview projects, hypothesis design and contacting officials and NGOs.  I will set out to do this after my other supervisor agree with this, hopefully before Christmas.
