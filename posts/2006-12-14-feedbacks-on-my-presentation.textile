Today I got feedbacks on my yesterday's presentation.  There are, as usual, more &quot;ticks&quot; than drawbacks.  However, my worrying was also proved true.<br /><br />Pros: nice structure and slide style (thanks to Beamer and LaTeX); good convey of project context; good delivery and efficient use of English language; good pacing; good handling of questions.<br /><br />Cons: a little too short (about only half as long as allowed); methodology too vague; better consider both social and natural &quot;resistance&quot; (but, I was talking about &quot;resilience&quot;?!).<br /><br />In a word, the cons mainly result from my limited effort on the methodology and planning of the project so far.  I will need to consider these parts soon.
