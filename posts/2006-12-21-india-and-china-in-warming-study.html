<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6201399.stm">BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | India and China in warming study</a><br /><br />This is a joint effort of two countries to study the effect of global warming on glaciers in Himalaya/Hindu Kush region.&nbsp; The melt of glaciers in this area is expected to bring flood to River Brahmaputra and River Sutlej in short term, and disappearance of the two rivers in a farther future.<br /><br />The significance of this study is evident: it involves an area that is controlling the climate system in the southern Asia-Pacific region and a large portion of world's population.&nbsp; It is also the only large scale charting survey of the area in about 100 years.&nbsp; It can be expected that the study will provide evidence of climate change and perhaps raise people's awareness of global warming crisis.&nbsp; However, I cannot deduce any further meanings from the information I have.&nbsp; A study providing an action plan may be more suitable.&nbsp; This requires more information on the area's demographical and ecological data so as to identify human activities' effect on the system.&nbsp; My current research is not directly related to this idea but my experience from it may help me in future in similar projects.<br /><br />The composition of the expedition team is not told in this story, but I hope they have ecologists and human geographers in the team as well as physical geographers.</div>
