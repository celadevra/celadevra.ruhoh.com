I managed to recover from graduation, somehow.&nbsp; The feedback for my presentation on 13th was quite positive.&nbsp; But that on my environmental review piece was somewhat &quot;uh, hmm, you know&quot;.&nbsp; The main issue is that I should give more details to make it really a reliable background to be put in my thesis.&nbsp; This means some additional writing and more searching within historical literatures.<br /><br />However, I barely have any time for the revision at this moment.&nbsp; My main tasks are to write a policy review (basically completed, phew), a methodology review (big task, working on it), and search for potential grants/awards.&nbsp; The methodology review is in fact easy to write, because there are many books and articles out there.&nbsp; However, I am sure I will encounter problems when I am &quot;in the field&quot;.&nbsp; So the best thing I can do now is to try to get more depth on this topic and perhaps think what are the potential problems of these methods.<br /><br />The Xmas is coming.&nbsp; I do not know if I should take a break at some point though.&nbsp; What I am sure is that if there is a break, it cannot be as long as I planned in November.</div>
