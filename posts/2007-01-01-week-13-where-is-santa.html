The week of Christmas days proved to be quite busy.&nbsp; I just found that qualitative research method review, though hardly anything new, can be very time-consuming because of the possible situations and problems one may encounter during the field study.&nbsp; Even if I write everything on the book down, I am pretty sure that I will have further problems when I am in the field.&nbsp; Most content of the review comes from three books, which I find all very useful.&nbsp; But other points of view must also be necessary for a good review.<br /><br />The funding hunt came to a halt.&nbsp; As I have no new idea about the possible sources of funding, I decided that I need to write a good proposal first.&nbsp; This in return involves determining the method I am going to use and planning for the field activities.&nbsp; I will try to contact some agencies to get more information and try to get some issues settled.<br /><br />Because the libraries are closed during the New Year, I managed to have a few days' rest.&nbsp; It is good for me to temporarily escape from what I have been doing for a few months.&nbsp; However, in the coming week I am sure there will be again a lot to deal with once the libraries are open and my supervisors come back to school.</div>
