Today's meeting with my supervisors was mainly around the topic money ... well, funding.&nbsp; I need to find a (few) small amount grant(s) to cover my expense on travelling to and from Tibet.&nbsp; I am glad that my supervisors are far more experienced on this issue than me and provided me with a few leads to start my searching.&nbsp; The rest of the task is mine: to produce a table listing all possible funding sources I can find.<br /><br />Also for the sake of funding application, we also discussed about the method I am going to use.&nbsp; My supervisor suggests that I look for not only geographical qualitative methods but also anthropological ones.&nbsp; So what's the difference between them?&nbsp; Right now I think the foci of the research are different between these two disciplines.&nbsp; Anthropology studies tend to stress on small-scale societies (Hammersley and Atkinson 1983).&nbsp; But what else differences are there?<br /><br />I borrowed a few books on ethnography from the library.&nbsp; I will read them to see if I can find some input on this question.&nbsp; Also, the proposal draft and funding list will keep me busy for the fortnight.</div>
