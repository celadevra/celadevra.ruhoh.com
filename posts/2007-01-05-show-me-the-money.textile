Today's meeting with my supervisors was mainly around the topic money ... well, funding.  I need to find a (few) small amount grant(s) to cover my expense on travelling to and from Tibet.  I am glad that my supervisors are far more experienced on this issue than me and provided me with a few leads to start my searching.  The rest of the task is mine: to produce a table listing all possible funding sources I can find.<br /><br />Also for the sake of funding application, we also discussed about the method I am going to use.  My supervisor suggests that I look for not only geographical qualitative methods but also anthropological ones.  So what's the difference between them?  Right now I think the foci of the research are different between these two disciplines.  Anthropology studies tend to stress on small-scale societies (Hammersley and Atkinson 1983).  But what else differences are there?<br /><br />I borrowed a few books on ethnography from the library.  I will read them to see if I can find some input on this question.  Also, the proposal draft and funding list will keep me busy for the fortnight.
