<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/dntt6j3utg38ua1k/">SpringerLink - Journal Article</a><br /><br />I came upon this interesting article this morning.&nbsp; The grassland ecosystem has two or more alternative states and the transitions between these states are often difficult.&nbsp; Grazing pressure and water condition to a large extent controls the states of vegetation.&nbsp; As the left figure shows, the control is non-linear.&nbsp; Between grazing pressure F<sub>c</sub> and F<sub>r</sub>, the system is in an alternative stable state.&nbsp; By making the system wetter, as the right figure shows, we may be able to increase F<sub>c</sub> and F<sub>r</sub> so the recovery will be easier.&nbsp; Thus the author suggested that during El Ni&ntilde;o which brings considerable precipitation maybe we can make the system go to the high biomass state by controlling grazing.&nbsp; However, field experiment will be needed to determine F<sub>r</sub>.<br /><br/><div align="center"><a href="http://snakehsu.info/photo/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=155&amp;g2_serialNumber=1" target="_blank"><img width="400" border="5" src="http://snakehsu.info/photo/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=155&amp;g2_serialNumber=1" alt="Adopted from Holmgren and Scheffer (2001)" /></a><br /></div><br/>Will this work in Tibet?&nbsp; For El Ni&ntilde;o I think the short answer is no.&nbsp; The longer answer: El Ni&ntilde;o does bring increased precipitation to Tibet, but that's in winter which does not help growing of grass but decrease the next year's summer precipitation by absorbing energy that pushes rain belt up to the plateau.&nbsp; So in El Ni&ntilde;o years things just go worse.&nbsp; But what about La Ni&ntilde;a?&nbsp; Perhaps in La Ni&ntilde;a years summer precipitation will increase so we can try the trick suggested by the author.&nbsp; I will seek some meteorological data from Lhasa to see if La Ni&ntilde;a brings more precipitation in summers.</div>
