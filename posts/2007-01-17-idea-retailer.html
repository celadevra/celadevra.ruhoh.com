Today I had a meeting with my supervisors concerning my research proposal for funding applications.&nbsp; I should say it is the first time I write a proposal for *real* funding application.&nbsp; And what I learned back in China is quite different from the conventions here.&nbsp; The comments given by my supervisors include:<br /><br/><ul><br/><li>Put research aim at first, then a little saucy background, then objectives, then methodology;</li><br/><li>Emphasise interdisciplinary research and justification on the reason to use them;</li><br/><li>Put site selection in a separate section instead of in methodology;</li><br/><li>Use precise figures in budget estimations, and be prepared to spend a lot in the field even if the price level is low there;</li><br/><li>Use Gantt Chart-like figures in the schedule part, illustrating fieldwork only;</li><br/><li>Be more specified;</li><br/><li>State that I will follow the School's health and safety guidelines (with URL).</li><br/></ul><br/>In a word, what I am trying to do is selling my idea.&nbsp; So I need to make a good packaging.</div>
