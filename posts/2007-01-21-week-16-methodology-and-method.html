The first two days of the week I tried to find out what are the missing details in my methodology review, so I borrowed books on anthropology from the library and read them through.&nbsp; I must admit this is awkward.&nbsp; I could hardly find large useful trunks from these books because I had written them in the review already.&nbsp; The more intriguing detail were also hard to grasp in my speedy reading.&nbsp; Anyway, it is not very useful to make a too detailed plan for anthropology research as much of it would be rendered useless in the field.&nbsp; A recon study may help me better find out suitable methods.<br /><br />The rest of the week is for funding again.&nbsp; I rewrote my proposal, which was not specified and attractive enough.&nbsp; I also tried to fill in a range of forms required by those grant-making agencies.&nbsp; Yes it is a especially useful skill either for a scholar or for a NGO staff.</div>
