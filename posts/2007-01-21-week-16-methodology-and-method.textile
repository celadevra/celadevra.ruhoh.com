The first two days of the week I tried to find out what are the missing details in my methodology review, so I borrowed books on anthropology from the library and read them through.  I must admit this is awkward.  I could hardly find large useful trunks from these books because I had written them in the review already.  The more intriguing detail were also hard to grasp in my speedy reading.  Anyway, it is not very useful to make a too detailed plan for anthropology research as much of it would be rendered useless in the field.  A recon study may help me better find out suitable methods.<br /><br />The rest of the week is for funding again.  I rewrote my proposal, which was not specified and attractive enough.  I also tried to fill in a range of forms required by those grant-making agencies.  Yes it is a especially useful skill either for a scholar or for a NGO staff.
