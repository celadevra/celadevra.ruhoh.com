Yesterday I had a lengthened training session on qualitative research.&nbsp; During a casual talk in tea time, a Brazilian(?) girl Leiz told me about her previous fieldwork, which was about &quot;disadvantaged farm workers&quot;.&nbsp; Well, I did not really consider my subjects of research can be labeled &quot;disadvantaged&quot; because I think the are the masters of the grassland in certain terms.&nbsp; However, her suggestions were useful that I should try everything to blend into the setting.&nbsp; This includes wearing similar clothes (I was wearing a Nike jumpsuit during the talk with her), do not mention terms like &quot;university&quot; &quot;science(-tific)&quot; &quot;PhD&quot; during the interview or observation, and be genuine about my attitude towards them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The last question forced me to muse on what role shall I take if I am not appearing as a research student.&nbsp; A curious tourist?&nbsp; A helper?&nbsp; Perhaps the role of a curious learner is suitable, which is also advocated by some anthropologists in their books.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Perhaps I should tell the government and the herdsmen that I want to learn how to manage herds.&nbsp; It is not completely a lie, though I need to talk to my supervisors about such ethical issue.</div>
