Yesterday I had a lengthened training session on qualitative research.  During a casual talk in tea time, a Brazilian(?) girl Leiz told me about her previous fieldwork, which was about &quot;disadvantaged farm workers&quot;.  Well, I did not really consider my subjects of research can be labeled &quot;disadvantaged&quot; because I think the are the masters of the grassland in certain terms.  However, her suggestions were useful that I should try everything to blend into the setting.  This includes wearing similar clothes (I was wearing a Nike jumpsuit during the talk with her), do not mention terms like &quot;university&quot; &quot;science(-tific)&quot; &quot;PhD&quot; during the interview or observation, and be genuine about my attitude towards them.  <br /><br />The last question forced me to muse on what role shall I take if I am not appearing as a research student.  A curious tourist?  A helper?  Perhaps the role of a curious learner is suitable, which is also advocated by some anthropologists in their books.   Hmm.  Perhaps I should tell the government and the herdsmen that I want to learn how to manage herds.  It is not completely a lie, though I need to talk to my supervisors about such ethical issue.
