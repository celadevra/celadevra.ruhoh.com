It is the third week that I put most effort into grant application.&nbsp; It seems the application will well take my next week.&nbsp; But by preparing the application materials I have a better grasp of the whole project.&nbsp; I feel more clear about how the research will be carried out in the field.<br /><br />I also begin to consider some more detailed issues about the study, such as its sensitivity and my workaround.&nbsp; I tried to write something about utilising remote sensing images in the study, though the sources are still limited.&nbsp; After the application is sent I think I will write it more systematically.</div>
