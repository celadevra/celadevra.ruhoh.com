It is the third week that I put most effort into grant application.  It seems the application will well take my next week.  But by preparing the application materials I have a better grasp of the whole project.  I feel more clear about how the research will be carried out in the field.<br /><br />I also begin to consider some more detailed issues about the study, such as its sensitivity and my workaround.  I tried to write something about utilising remote sensing images in the study, though the sources are still limited.  After the application is sent I think I will write it more systematically.
