From the blooming literature on resilience and its modelling, perhaps we can say resilience study is becoming more mature and practical in recent years.&nbsp; There seems to be some patterns to follow when one is doing resilience study: identify the actors, drivers, limiting factors and pressures, then establish the conceptual model, then build mathematical models, and then see what happens when you get the data.&nbsp; However, I cannot find many articles questioning the validity of this mode of research.&nbsp; One possible solution to the situation, is to study the same area with two independent modelling process, preferably by two researchers, and see if the results are comparable.&nbsp; I would like to invite anyone interested in this topic to do this with me after I get my PhD in three years.<br /><br />I have encountered some excellent models of resilience focusing on various ecosystems.&nbsp; What interested me most is of course those of rangeland resilience.&nbsp; Apparently they all select the output capacity of the system as their objective and indicator of resilience, though the measures are different among models.&nbsp; I agree with this idea.&nbsp; However, most models only measure ecological variables such as water availability and nutrient flux.&nbsp; I believe that in the coming years we will see more attempts to incorporate socio-economic factors into the model.&nbsp; Mathematically this is not too difficult.&nbsp; The real labourous work is to identify these factors and evaluate them.<br /><br />The modelling of Tibetan pastoralism resilience must have something different from that in other rangeland ecosystems.&nbsp; Perhaps I can expect more limiting factors, more sensitive system, and some factors imposed by the cultural, political and economic environment, which cannot simply appear in other places of the world.</div>
