The application for grant is going on.&nbsp; Although it has been edited thoroughly for a few times, there seems always to be some thing to add, something to rephrase, and something that are not looking good but I do not know what to do with it.&nbsp; However, I think there is progress and the document is almost ready to be sent.<br /><br />I went on to spend some time on remote sensing and models of resilience.&nbsp; Both would be needed if I am going to impress them in the interview, I think.&nbsp; Besides, my thesis also needs sections on these topics.&nbsp; As I am merely browsing literature and record things that are interest, there is little difficulty in this.&nbsp; However, I believe that once I am in the field there will be much more troubles.&nbsp; On the other hand, maybe I am using it as an escape from the tedious editing work?&nbsp; I am not sure.<br /><br />In the following months I will need to prepare the field work, as well as consider my proposal and annual report.&nbsp; I may well write them back in China, which means I will need to write a lot of notes here.</div>
