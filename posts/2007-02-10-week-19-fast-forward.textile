The application for grant is going on.  Although it has been edited thoroughly for a few times, there seems always to be some thing to add, something to rephrase, and something that are not looking good but I do not know what to do with it.  However, I think there is progress and the document is almost ready to be sent.<br /><br />I went on to spend some time on remote sensing and models of resilience.  Both would be needed if I am going to impress them in the interview, I think.  Besides, my thesis also needs sections on these topics.  As I am merely browsing literature and record things that are interest, there is little difficulty in this.  However, I believe that once I am in the field there will be much more troubles.  On the other hand, maybe I am using it as an escape from the tedious editing work?  I am not sure.<br /><br />In the following months I will need to prepare the field work, as well as consider my proposal and annual report.  I may well write them back in China, which means I will need to write a lot of notes here.
