I finally finished writing the application document for the fieldwork grant and can focus my energy fully on research methodology and other issues.  However, I find with frustration that I cannot progress much further from what I have done in the past weeks.<br /><br />It is possible, that I have already obtained enough general knowledge about remote sensing, and to study further and deeper will not be feasible without some actual work on real data.  However I still find I know too little about CORONA and mixed-scale image interpretation.<br /><br />The training at the end of the week about observation methods in ethnography is not more helpful than the previous introduction course which covered other topics.  However I still managed to get a flavour about observation from the course.  It seems that structured observation will not be suitable for the project as I have no detailed idea of what I am going to observe.  On the other hand, observing a group in a different culture may be very misleading.  I had better have a Tibetan interpreter by then.<br /><br />I got my feedback for the last two essays for Critical Human Geography course.  The marks are both better than I expected.  Worth a small celebration and I am more confident about finishing the other two.
