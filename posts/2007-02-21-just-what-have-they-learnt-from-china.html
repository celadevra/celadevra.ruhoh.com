<a href="http://www.unep.org/billiontreecampaign/index.asp">-- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - BillionTree Campaign Site --</a><br /><br />I read the news from the <a target="_blank" href="http://earthtrends.wri.org/updates/node/146">EarthTrends Blog</a>.&nbsp; Some people may find this campaign exciting but I feel a bit uneasy about this.<br /><br />Such pledge reminds me of some mass environmental movements used to take place in China.&nbsp; My memory about planting trees is not so pleasant.&nbsp; The result of China's tree-planting campaign is a total failure -- failed to stop sand, managed to drain water.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason is simple: trees do not grow everywhere and should not be grown everywhere.&nbsp; It can become a destructive factor in certain ecosystems, especially those heavily managed by human, e.g. rangelands.&nbsp; On the other hand, trees artificially planted often need intensive care, without which they will just die and contribute to carbon emission instead of absorbing it.<br /><br />I can see that UNEP is trying to mobilise the people -- anyone with some soil can plant a tree, no matter where it is.&nbsp; However, it runs contrarily with land management policies in many places in EU; it is not practical in already crowded Asia; it is a burden for many people in Africa and South America.&nbsp; In places not adequate it can take away considerable water.&nbsp; The target of 1 billion trees is just too ambitious.&nbsp; Up to when I am writing, the number of trees planted is just about half a million, without stating how many survived.<br /><br />I cannot find any endorsement from ecologists on the campaign's website nor any sound ecological rationale behind it.&nbsp; If they really want to compensate for trees being cut down in Amazon they should stop the saws instead of swing the shovels, or at least provide a plan about where and when to plant trees.&nbsp; This campaign is to me too ambiguous, too <em>ad hoc</em>, and too irrational to be an UNEP initiative.&nbsp; If they want to learn mass movement from China they should also learn about the consequence.</div>
