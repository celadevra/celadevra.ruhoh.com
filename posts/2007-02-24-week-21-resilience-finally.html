My two pieces about methodology and policies written before the grant application was praised by my supervisors.&nbsp; Now the focus is shifted to physical methodology and resilience.<br /><br />We agreed that I should write something on resilience.&nbsp; I read something on this at the beginning of my project.&nbsp; However my concept of the project has changed much since then.&nbsp; I think I will have to seek some different literatures from those I read before.<br /><br />Some concepts, such as adaptive cycles, need more clarification.&nbsp; The most important objective is to find out feasible models and indicators for assessing rangeland resilience.</div>
