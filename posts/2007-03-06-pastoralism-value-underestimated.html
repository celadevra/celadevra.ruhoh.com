<a href="http://www.eldis.org/cf/search/disp/DocDisplay.cfm?Doc=DOC23878&amp;resource=f1pastoralism">Eldis - Pastoralism</a><br /><br />Eldis seems like to publish tediously long articles on pastoralism.&nbsp; Luckily they often also provided executive summary.&nbsp; I browsed the article linked here.&nbsp; It is not quite shocking discovery but is still revealing and well justified.<br /><br />We all know that government policies are largely based on economic considerations, if not completely.&nbsp; So, if you want the government to involve in the conservation or exploitation of something, the best approach is to make them believe that such a proposal is profitable.&nbsp; The reason why pastoralism has been neglected and considered not an ideal land-use lies in its poor economic outlook.&nbsp; When I say the word &quot;herdsmen&quot; what do you come up with?&nbsp; Exhausted men and women with shabby clothes?&nbsp; Barren land?&nbsp; Children who cannot attend school and with snivel hanging above their mouths?&nbsp; Read on.<br /><br />The author of the article cited here claims that the actual economic value of pastoralism has been severely underestimated.&nbsp; If we try to replace this sector with some &quot;modern&quot; meat/milk production system or other economies, the result is a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;: increasing poverty, resource conflict and environmental degradation that reinforces the very preconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding pastoralism as a livelihood system.&nbsp; Therefore, pastoralism needs to be re-valuated to make sure the government know what economic loss can take place with loss of pastoralism.<br /><br />The new calculation framework proposed by the author is called TEV -- Total Economic Value.&nbsp; In my opinion it is a implementation of the framework given by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/davidpearce.php">David Pearce</a> in his <em>Blueprint</em>s.&nbsp; No actual value in dollar is given though, because to convert all the items in the list to monetary values still needs considerable calculation for each country.&nbsp; However, this framework is operational and can be used in loss-benefit analysis.<br /><br />Governments have enough reason to reconsider their policies on pastoralism after a calculation using this framework.&nbsp; After all, pastoralism is worth preserving.&nbsp; However, what about the impact of pastoralism?&nbsp; Do we as well underestimated or ignored some negative effects of it?&nbsp; Such discussions may make any argument about pastoralism more solid.</div>
