Last week's literature research did not end up quite well, I have to say.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that I find it hard to define a quantity for resilience.&nbsp; You may find some quantitative indicators for resilience, but that does not mean you can use quantitative method globally.&nbsp; <br /><br />There seems to be more concepts than formulas for these particular problem.&nbsp; I do not know if I can do a project largely built on qualitative research while still being accepted by the thesis committee.&nbsp; I believe that a suitable approach to combine both qualitative and quantitative characteristics is desirable and important.&nbsp; <br /><br />For a variety of ecosystems, there have been successful examples of utilising resilience concept in management and research.&nbsp; This, however, must be built on considerable support and data, as well as careful analysis.</div>
