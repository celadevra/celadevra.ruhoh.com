Before trying to measure resilience for a pasture ecosystem, a natural question is what indicators should be chosen.&nbsp; The change of the indicators' value will lead to the flipping of the system's state, i.e. exceeding the boundaries of domains of attraction.<br /><br />Slowly changing variables are not necessarily indicators that can be directly measured.&nbsp; One reason, is that as its name indicates, they change slowly, in a short time period one can even consider them as fixed value.&nbsp; Some slowly changing variables are too subtle, or technically hard to measure.<br /><br />However, to determine the indicator one must address the slowly changing variables.&nbsp; So, what are the slowly changing variables for pasture lands?&nbsp; It is a hard question without a conceptual model at hand.&nbsp; And a proper conceptual model is almost&nbsp; impossible without being in the field and observe.&nbsp; Anyway, I will try to come up with some ideas about the slowly changing variables while I am in my armchair.<br /><br />In an Australian rangeland ecosystem, one of the major driver is the ability of plants to draw water from the soil.&nbsp; Therefore the texture and moisture of soil will be a slow factor (Anderies et al., 2002).<br /><br />The grass-shrub ratio in certain systems can also be an underlying slowly changing variable (Walker, 1993).&nbsp; <br /><br />What are the others?&nbsp; Purely guestimate, nutrient in such a poor-nutrient system may play some intriguing role.&nbsp; It will influence the composition of plants, and very likely the grass biomass.&nbsp; Both are important slowly changing variables in Australian rangeland ecosystem.</div>
