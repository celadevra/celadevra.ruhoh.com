It feels great to finish the last literature review on resilience.&nbsp; The last few days working on this subject has been quite painful.&nbsp; Though a quite innovative way of describing and analysing ecosystems, only a few number of people are developing this tool well and made some significant contributions.&nbsp; This makes the relevant literatures fully occupied by these few people and somewhat dull.<br /><br />However, by studying them I think I really have some ideas about how my project will proceed.&nbsp; A field visit is necessary before any conceptual model can be developed.&nbsp; This conceptual model and mathematical model developed from it will help one identify slowly changing variables.&nbsp; Later one can use techniques such as bifurcation analysis or scaling to determine the boundaries of domain of attraction, thus the resilience of the system.<br /><br />So far I cannot start anything yet on resilience study.&nbsp; In the next month I will mainly think about my pilot study.&nbsp; If I have more time I may consider making a poster for my project.&nbsp; I will need that sooner or later.</div>
