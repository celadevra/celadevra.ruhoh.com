It feels great to finish the last literature review on resilience.  The last few days working on this subject has been quite painful.  Though a quite innovative way of describing and analysing ecosystems, only a few number of people are developing this tool well and made some significant contributions.  This makes the relevant literatures fully occupied by these few people and somewhat dull.<br /><br />However, by studying them I think I really have some ideas about how my project will proceed.  A field visit is necessary before any conceptual model can be developed.  This conceptual model and mathematical model developed from it will help one identify slowly changing variables.  Later one can use techniques such as bifurcation analysis or scaling to determine the boundaries of domain of attraction, thus the resilience of the system.<br /><br />So far I cannot start anything yet on resilience study.  In the next month I will mainly think about my pilot study.  If I have more time I may consider making a poster for my project.  I will need that sooner or later.
