<a href="http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/papers/miller5.htm">Restocking and Settling Nomads Following Severe Snowstorms</a><br /><br />As a chapter in a book this article is especially useful to me and perhaps many other nomadism students.&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides some perspectives on snowstorms, and traditional Tibetan pastoralism.&nbsp; It discussed about some common fallacies hold by the mass and the authorities over the nomadism in Tibet.<br /><br />Of more value, the article introduced the historical changes taken place in Tibetan pastoralism in the past decades, as well as information on a few past snowstorms, which will surely help my project.</div>
