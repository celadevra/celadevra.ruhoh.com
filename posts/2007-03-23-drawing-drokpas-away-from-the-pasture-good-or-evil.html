I just noticed that it is part of the state's pastoralism policy that <em>drokpa</em>s are not only encouraged to reduce or stop grazing on certain pastures, but also to leave the land and enter the Third Industry.<br /><br />The rationale behind this is that <em>drokpa</em>s are mostly living a materially-deprived life.&nbsp; The policy will help them get richer by drawing them into service industries.&nbsp; The <em>drokpa</em>s remain on the pasture will then be able to have larger pastures for their herds, and eventually become ranch managers like those in the U. S. or Australia.&nbsp; <br /><br />But such measure does not necessarily increase individual pastoralists' strength, or resilience, in the face of sudden natural disasters.&nbsp; Traditionally, the <em>drokpa</em>s divert the risk of snowstorms and droughts by dispersing their herds among those of their relatives or friends.&nbsp; The arrangement that less <em>drokpa</em>s now occupy the pastures will disturb such traditional risk aversion method.&nbsp; The ranch manager without nearby relatives/friends to help him/her will inevitably rely singly on the state's aid in case of disasters.&nbsp; This may reduce the system's resilience.<br /><br />It is also doubtful whether the new Third Industry staffed by <em>drokpa</em>s is sustainable.&nbsp; Due to the economic development in Tibet at this moment, the Third Industry will mainly serve people from outside.&nbsp; This will bring currency to the region.&nbsp; But the limited income, except for several large cities, cannot be invested in other means than self-sustaining.&nbsp; Based on tourism only, without the support of the First and Second Industry, such Third Industry may swarm in large cities, living small cities and towns deprived of labour.&nbsp; Thus the gap between richer and poorer counties may be widened.<br /><br />I still do not know to what extent has this policy being carried out and what are the effects.&nbsp; I will take this question along with me in the field and seek answers.</div>
