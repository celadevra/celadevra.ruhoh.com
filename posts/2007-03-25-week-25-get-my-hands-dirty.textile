The feedback on my previous piece of writing on resilience is a bit unexpected.  Apparently my supervisors and I have some disagreement on our perception of resilience.  The resilience I am familiar with has a strong ecological origin and may not be quite the same as those about social-economic systems.  It is suggested that I take a look at vulnerability studies in both social and ecological terms.  <br /><br />The introduce of the concept in my writing is a bit too steep.  Considering the audience of my thesis I am also told to rewrite the piece to make it more understandable by others.  More examples, if available, can make my writing more detailed and grounded.<br /><br />The following three week or so, I will divert considerable time and effort to make a series of plans for the field trip.  It is not as interesting as studying concepts, but will be an essential part of my project.
