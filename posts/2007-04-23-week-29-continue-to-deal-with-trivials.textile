If I had better information when I was booking my ticket, I would have been packing and prepare for leaving this week. However I have to stay for another week or I have to pay dearly for a reschedule of my ticket.<br/><br/>Trying not to be too idle, I tried to come up with the structure of my annual report, as well as a data management system which should help me organise potentially large amount of notes and other raw data.<br/><br/>At the same time I tried to find some anecdotes from previous travellers who had been to Tibet in the hope that some of these writings may be helpful in providing some information on what to expect in the field. However, so far there has not been any useful hints from these materials.
