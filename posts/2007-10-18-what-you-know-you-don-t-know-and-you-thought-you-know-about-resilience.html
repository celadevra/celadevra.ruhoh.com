Today I stumped on [this article](http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss1/art13/main.html) on [Google Scholar](http://www.google.com/).  I think it is a good one for people just beginning to study resilience (with all due respect; those people include me).<br/><br/>I haven't got time to read it slowly but from my skimming I think it is good in terms of clarifying some concepts and methodology issues.  Return to it from time to time we may save ourselves considerable energy and do more sound research.<br/><br/>The article has no access restriction as long as you have Internet connection.</div>
