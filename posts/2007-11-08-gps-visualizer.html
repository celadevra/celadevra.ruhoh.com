[GPS Visualizer](http://gpsvisualizer.com/)<br/><br/><br/>This is an essential for geography hobbists and serious GE users.  Without a flashy interface (yet?), this site provides a rich set of tools to help you visualise geographic data on Google Maps and Google Earth.  Haven't got time for all its features, but the first thing I am going to do with it is to create a Landsat overlay of my study area.  More details in later posts.</div>
