This is an initiative by Google UK.  [Here](http://www.google.co.uk/CarbonFootprint) is the link and it will become a new tab on your iGoogle page.<br/><br/>My carbon footprint currently is 2.2 tonnes, which is below UK average but my once or twice a year flight back home makes my travelling footprint very close to or exceeding UK average.</div>
