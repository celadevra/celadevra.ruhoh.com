[Informed multi-objective decision-making in environmental management using Pareto optimality](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01367.x)<br/><br/>Multi-objective decision making has been the feature of many environmental management cases, yet there is no effective solutions to optimisation problems with multiple objectives.  This article proposes non-dominated Pareto optimisation and an evolutionary algorithm that can approximate the non-dominated Pareto frontier.  A case study is provided.<br/><br/>The problem seems to be the spatial complexity, which is especially announced in environmental studies, as well as the algorithm's intrinsic complexity.  One assumption of this algorithm that cannot be ignored is that approximation to optimised decisions will produce results approximate to the optimised result, which may not always be valid in the non-linear world.<br/><br/>The result space is potentially very large and needs to be reduced to a few decision alternatives that can be understood and chosen from by the decision-maker.<br/><br/>Despite all these possible caveats, this algorithm seems to be in the right direction towards a more holistic assessment and making of environment decisions.  And potentially similar ideas can be applied in my research.</div>
