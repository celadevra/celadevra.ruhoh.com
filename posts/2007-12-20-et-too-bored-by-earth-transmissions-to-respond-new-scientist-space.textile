"ET too bored by Earth transmissions to respond":http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13096-et-too-bored-by-earth-transmissions-to-respond.html<br/><br/>Interesting idea. Extra-terrestrial life may have already received too many radio signals that are plain and dull so they do not have a lot of incentives to reply. More meaningful and thought provoking information is being drafted and sent to space. If there are alien scientists out there they may well find such information worth a look.<br/><br/>But what is really interesting is the comment below the article there on NewScientist website. Just like Carl Sagan predicted in a more drastic way, you got all kinds of reactions to the vision that some aliens (probably much more advanced than we mankind) may pick up the signal and decide if they will visit us. There are self-inflicted discrimination, loathing the world, and of course worries about potential Armageddon. Are we really mature enough to start active SETI? We still have got a few generation's time at least before the signal reaches somebody out there, but mankind may need much more than that to become used to have a neighbour, or many neighbours.
