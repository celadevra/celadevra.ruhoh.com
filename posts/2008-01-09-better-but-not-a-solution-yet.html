I think I am a bio-fuel advocate-turned-skeptic now.<br /><br />Both <a href="http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726384.900-switchgrass-revives-hopes-for-biofuels.html">NewScientist</a> and <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn">SciAm</a> report that a native North American perennial grass, switch grass <i>Panicum virgatum</i> can produce 540% of the energy used to grow it.&nbsp; It has been naturally growing at field margins in U. S. for years, yet recently become a new focus in bio-fuel development.&nbsp; Without doubt its efficiency in producing energy beats the criticism that bio-fuel growing is not energy-efficient.&nbsp; It even has nearly permanent underground root system that offset 94 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted to cultivate it and from derived ethanol.&nbsp; Neat isn't it?<br /><br />However I think environment aware farmers will face certain dilemma when they decide whether to plant it or not.&nbsp; By definition it can be grown on marginal land without intensive care.&nbsp; But it would take many households' yield to form a quantity that is worth further process.&nbsp; The ethanol yield on a field is 2,000 to 3,500 litres/ha, which about equals to 1,300 to 2,250 litres of petrol (using data from <a href="http://www.sekab.com/default.asp?id=1901&amp;refid=1982&amp;l3=1974#7">here</a> and <a href="http://www.sekab.com/default.asp?id=1888&amp;refid=1978&amp;l3=1974">here</a>).&nbsp; For an average truck that carries the grass from a farm to refinery, the fuel supports it to run for 860 to 1,500 kilometres (using 2005 data from <a href="http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_04_14_m.html">here</a>).&nbsp; There was not an estimate of farm-refinery data that I can find, but <a href="www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf">this report</a> claims that local food travels on average 56 miles to reach institutional market, convert this to kilometres and times 2, the travel from a refinery to a farm and back along takes about 180 kilometres.&nbsp; This part was not calculated in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0704767105">the model used to calculate net energy yields</a>.&nbsp; Considering that the bio-fuel production is very distributed, it is necessary to incorporate this into the analysis.&nbsp; If the switchgrass is really grown on marginal land, it is very possible that the collector will need to travel more miles before obtaining adequate amount of raw materials for production.<br /><br />If the grass is grown in field scale, not on marginal land, problems for other bio-fuel plants also exist: investment of land and water, fertilizers and so on.&nbsp; Like all technology, it is dangerous if people are too obsessed and invest their land and money blindly on the switchgrass.&nbsp; With a similar unit area ethanol yield to corn, it still will take considerable land to make the production practical and profitable.&nbsp; The discovery itself is remarkable.&nbsp; But it will not be the single solution to energy problem in the US, nor should it become an excuse to put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.<br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p></div>
