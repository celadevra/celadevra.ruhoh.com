<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7227080.stm" target="_blank">BBC news</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/scientists-identify-tipping-points-of-climate-change-778027.html" target="_blank">the Independent</a> both report that researchers attempted to identify ``tipping point'' events resulted by climate change and managed to find 9 so far.  The result will be published on the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/" target="_blank">PNAS Journal</a> but as of the moment I create this entry I am not able to find the report on the PNAS site.<br/><br/>Among the 9 irreversible events, I pay most attention to the ``collapse'' of the Indian summer monsoon.  The BBC website states that this may happen in as near as 1 year.  I hope that was a typo.  This event will have the most direct effect on Asia climate, especially precipitation.  Pollution caused cooling over the land, which reduces the land-sea temperature gradient and thus the driver of Indian summer monsoon.  Intensified El Ni√±o may also cause increased snow in the winter and reduce land temperature in the summer.</div>
