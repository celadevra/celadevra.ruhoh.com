Although the author did mention that the rapidly increasing foreign trade ports and airports in China makes the control of imported horticulture products more difficult.  Apparently, species emigration and immigration happens at the same time on both borders.  This is a new challenge to biodiversity conservation, and perhaps a result of globalisation.  The problem is as old as trade itself, but nowadays at a completely different scale.  Impact can be limited, though, if both sides take actions.</div>
