<br/>In the US, McDonald's and Wendy's along with Burger King are selling essentially the same food.  By comparing Carbon-12 and its radioactive brother Carbon-13 ratios in the food, researchers conclude that the ultimate source of fast food in the US is <A href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/11/10/0809870105" target="_blank">one single crop called corn</A>.<br/><br/>This may not be a surprising discovery after all.  Beef used in fast food comes from cattle feed on corn; corn oil or its mixture with other oils is used for fried food; and corn syrup is used to sweeten soft drink.  The implication however calls for more attention.  Fast food accounts for a half of the US' commercial <A class="zem_slink" title="Food industry" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_industry">food production</A>, and the base of this food industry empire is on a single crop whose plantation is often regarded as unsustainable.<br/><br/>The environmental impact of corn production is mentioned <A href="http://environmentalalmanac.blogspot.com/2007/08/environmental-impacts-of-increasing.html" target="_blank">in this blog</A>, as well as reports by <A href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=environmental-impact-of-corn-based-plastics" target="_blank">SciAm</A> and <A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/06/AR2008030603294.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post</A>.  The charges on corn include intensive use of pesticides and fertiliser, consuming land and water resources and eat away a large portion of energy.  Apparently eating fast food not only increases your size but also your ecological/carbon footprint.<br/><br/><br/>
