A project aiming at utilising <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_power" title="Tidal power" rel="wikipedia">tidal power</a> has caused various environmental groups to "express their worries":http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jan/26/severn-barrage-tidal that one of the shortlisted proposal may cause significant environment damage.<br/><br/>The proposal of question involves building a 10-mile barrage at "Severn Estuary":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Estuary. It is a worry shared by many environmentalists that such a project may @add to local flooding, reduce fish stocks, damage bird life and destroy the Severn bore, as well as ruin mudflats across an area of more than 77 square miles''.  The environmental groups prefers a new technology called tidal lagoon, whose benefit is still not verified, and is believed to be more expensive and generate less energy.  Two lagoon proposals made the shortlist.<br/><br/>Despite voices against the barrage proposal, it is believed that the 8 giga-watt project accounting for 5% of UK's electricity need is quite attractive to the decision makers and may well be carried out.  The issue is further complicated by accusations that the cost of lagoon solutions was overestimated in the assessment.<br/><br/>Documents about the feasibility studies of the project can be found at the [project's government website](http://severntidalpowerconsultation.decc.gov.uk/).  Today also marks the beginning of the first public consultation on the project.  You can@have your say'' after register on the website.<br/><br/>
