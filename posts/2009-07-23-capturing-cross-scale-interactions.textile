People studying ecological resilience talk about cross-scale interactions a lot. Yet people often claim that cross-scale interaction is in play without quantitative evidence. "Researchers from Argentina":http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0091-9 in 2005 proposed to use regression on data sets collected in different years to identify the existence of cross-scale interactions.<br/><br/>The approach cannot tell what really is cross-interacting with other variables, yet. And being a statistical method, it requires a huge amount of data. Perhaps by regression of multiple series and types of data, and with the aid of conceptual models, this approach can bring more insight into the system.
