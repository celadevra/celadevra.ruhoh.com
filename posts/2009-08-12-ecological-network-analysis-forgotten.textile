<span style="float: left; padding: 5px;"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"><img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0;"/></a></span><br/><br/>A new "preprint article":http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.07.012 pop up in _Ecological Modelling_'s RSS feed today, showing a case study using ecological network analysis in the functional assessment of an estuary ecosystem. I was wondering what is ecological network analysis, and how it assesses a system's function, so I read on.<br/><br/>It turns out that the technical details of ecological network analysis involves food web and information theory. The former I have some understanding, but the latter is too complex for me as a newcomer to dwell in the late night. "Here":http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca/files/ECOPATH%20IISoftwareForEcosystemModels%20_SmallerFileSize.pdf is the paper describing the ECOPATH II model used by the preprint article. Judging from its number of being cited, many people must have used it successfully in their studies. However, the authors of the model acknowledged that it is based on a steady-state assumption, which arguably hardly exist in any real ecosystem, thus they recommend it used only in snapshot descriptions of ecosystems.<br/><br/>I doubt such a model can be used to describe ecosystem functions, considering that ecosystem functions do not present themselves in full in a &quot;snapshot&quot;. The authors of the preprint article seem confident that this method at least identify ecosystem functions based on the goal of management defined by researchers and decision makers. But I think the role of artifacts and stochasticity in this is too significant to let pass.<br/><br/>In preliminary studies, I think this method has its use. If researchers can establish the food web structure and nutrient dynamics in a system, we may use this method to identify some key species or functions of the system. However, its results must be iteratively put back to our picture of the system, to check whether it conforms the dynamics and management goals. The method seems to work only with &quot;pure&quot; ecosystems, while many researchers have moved on to study social-ecological complex systems. I wonder if this is the reason why the method has been silent for all these years.<br/><br/><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.jtitle=Ecological+Modelling&rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.ecolmodel.2009.07.012&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&rft.atitle=Ecological+network+analyses+and+their+use+for+establishing+reference+domain+in+functional+assessment+of+an+estuary&rft.issn=03043800&rft.date=2009&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.epage=&rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0304380009004931&rft.au=Christian%2C+R.&rft.au=Brinson%2C+M.&rft.au=Dame%2C+J.&rft.au=Johnson%2C+G.&rft.au=Peterson%2C+C.&rft.au=Baird%2C+D.&rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CEcology%2C+Systems+Biology">Christian, R., Brinson, M., Dame, J., Johnson, G., Peterson, C., &amp; Baird, D.
