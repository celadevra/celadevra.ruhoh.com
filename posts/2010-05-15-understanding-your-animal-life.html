<p>It must be quite interesting to examine the life of Maggie Gee as a writer with more than an educated mental profile in herself, and presented by herself.  To me, it is always hard to imagine how can any professional writer write seemingly not for building a brand, but out of oneâ€™s desire to write.  Who can maintain such an attitude for decades?</p><br /><p>The answer may be found in her autography <em>My Animal Life</em>.  The passion of writing may be coming from her recognition of multiple factors which shaped her personality, and the complexity of a person who is both a sentient being and a product of natural processes.  Possibly, it is out of the need to understand oneself, one set out to understand the forces that contributed to her present condition.</p></div>
