I just started reading VSI: Design this afternoon.  The first few pages have been quite inspiring already.  The word "design" is another shifting expression that is hard to define and subject to misunderstanding.  However, it can be defined as an essential human characteristics that determines the quality of human life.  Everything is capable of improvement if more attention is paid to how they function and how they organize, and design is such an optimization process.
