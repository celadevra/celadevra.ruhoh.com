I received the notice that I am going to do the presentation today when I was in China, busy packing my luggage to go back to England.  So it was quite a fuss.  Luckily I was preparing a presentation knowing that I will need it some time.<br/><br/>The most difficult thing is to introduce the concept of resilience to an audience of human geography background.  Sometimes I wonder why I do such a ``biological'' project at school of Geography.  However, things turned not so bad.  Resilience has become a more widely accepted metaphor and method nowadays.<br/><br/>The slide I made lack a bit of consistency I am afraid.  It may left the audience trying to grab the topic.  It would be better if there are some links between the different parts.<br/><br/>Next week there will be another group of PhD students doing presentation, I think I'd better learn from them about how to make more understandable presentations....</div>
