I am reading a chapter in Deleuze and Guattari (1988) about this concept, although I have not found this concept particularly useful from what I have read so far.&nbsp; Other than prevailing dichotomic approach to describing the world, Deleuze proposes rhizome, which is very diverse and dynamic.&nbsp; It can have multiple connections with a range of subjects and objects.&nbsp; On the other hand it has no points or positions within itself.&nbsp; Most people can argue that this is basically the nature of almost everything, and rhizome cannot give more insights than reductionist dichotomies.<br /><br />However, the latter characteristics of rhizome may be more interesting: multiplicity, asignification of rupture, nature of cartography.&nbsp; It is heterogeneous yet can be divided, illustratable yet untraceable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Deleuze also linked the idea of rhizome to &quot;the East&quot;.&nbsp; Compared to Western attachment to tree, the Eastern culture is somewhat like grass: the rhizome.&nbsp; But this may be another kind of dualism.<br /><br />The form of the book itself is quite subtle, even in some kind of chaos.&nbsp; Rhizome may never be fully understood in the context of such form and Western writings -- they are not abstract enough.&nbsp; It does provide a way of thinking, though maybe not explaining or interpreting.&nbsp; I can look at many, almost any, things as rhizomes, but once I begin to explain something using this perspective, it is not rhizome any more, at least in certain scales.<br /><br />There are sociology researches trying to use rhizome in the formation of their theories.&nbsp; But I think to grasp the idea, one has to solidify it to some point.&nbsp; Therefore to some extent it is not rhizome anymore!&nbsp; This is a bit mysticism but currently I cannot better understand this....</div>
