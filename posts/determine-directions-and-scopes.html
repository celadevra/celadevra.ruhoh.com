I am going to start PhD program soon.  However, the proposal I wrote in a haste do not help much in defining my study.  I hope the study is ecology-oriented.  I also understand that non-natural elements should also be addressed in the study.  I just wonder how much social science should be involved in this project.<br/><br/>It is also important to realise that all my theories on sustainability so far are based on western discourse and neo-classical economistic models of rational human behaviour and response (Wynne, 1996).  When studying an oriental/tibetan system such theories may not correctly reflect the problem.</div>
