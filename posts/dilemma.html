This Sunday we will have a discussion on selection of team members of this year's mountaineering team and scientific exploration team. I, as the vice president of our climbing club who don't go mountaineering, will take part in this discussion.<br/><br/>There is a girl, whom I wish could be in the exploration team. She provided the most foundamental idea for this year's topic. Her knowlegde on social science would surely help us. But she herself eagerly want to go mountaineering. As a member of the board, I need to make my choice: enhance the ability of my team, or support her wish?<br/><br/>I had struggle. However, after I knew that she did so much to take part in mountaineering, I have made my decision. I will do my best to help her enter the mountaineering team.</div>
