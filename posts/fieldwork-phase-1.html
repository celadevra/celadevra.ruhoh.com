I just come back from it.<br/><br/>I have encountered more sphagnum patches than I expected, though some are rather stressed, especially those on the south-facing slopes.  Perhaps it is because of more sunlight and less moisture.  Besides, there are very few sphagnum patches larger than 5 metres in any dimension, except some in SK0993 in those gullies.<br/><br/>Besides, I just found that many sphagnum patches can be found in these ESA vegetation types: cottongrass moorland, dry bog heather or non-heather dominated.  I&#39;ll do a chi-square test to see if the hypothesis is true: that land use type is related to sphagnum presence.<br/><br/>A possible spectral signature can be found using about 20 sphagnum patches I found this time.  The problem is the difference between aerial photographs made large-scale classification complicated: you have to identify sphagnum patches one square km by another.  This could mean extensive fieldwork next phase.<br/><br/>The validation of these signatures is another problem.&nbsp; I can guess they are pretty good predictions, but this must be verified using more fieldwork data.<br/><br/>I may need to do more study on sphagnum habitats considering elevation and hydrology.&nbsp; I also need to talk with Jack in the coming weeks.&nbsp; For the next period, the main focus will be on hydrology models.&nbsp;</div>

The data were organised into a 2x2 contingency table.<br><br>Dry bogs and cottongrass moorlands are defined as suitable habitats, the rest are unsuitable.<br><br>The result of the chi-square test:<br><br>Using pure Pearson&#39;s chi-square test, chi-square = 7.04, p = 0.008 .  Using Pearson&#39;s chi-square test with Yates&#39; Continuity Correction, chi-square= 5.88, p = 0.0153.  Thus the null hypothesis is rejected on a 0.05 credibility level.  Sphagnum observed depend on vegetation types.</div>
