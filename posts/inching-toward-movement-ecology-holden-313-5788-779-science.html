<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/313/5788/779">Inching Toward Movement Ecology -- Holden 313 (5788): 779 -- Science</a>  This issue of  Science caught my eyes because the theme is migration and dispersal, which is somehow related to my dissertation topic.  I find that I am tackling a topic which has very wide coverage and considerable influence in ecology studies.  It is possible that I may continue research in this direction.  However, I still think my work should be related to fragile ecosystems.</div>
