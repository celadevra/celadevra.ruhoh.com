This noon when I was having my lunch on the bench outside the school building, I tried to go through my research plan again, then I realised that I need data on two seasons for two types of pastoralists.&nbsp; Thus I may need to go to the field as early as in summer 2007, then I will have time and experience to do a fieldwork in winter 2007.&nbsp; If there is not one in summer 2007, I will have to wait until summer 2008 considering the winter climate and lack of experience, and surely will have to spend some time in Tibet in 2009 when I should be writing up my thesis.<br /><br />On one side this is a good opportunity for me to reunite Amy, on the other side it could mean a lot of preparation and hassle of learning sociology methods, contacting central and local officials/academics, and maybe studying/borrowing devices.&nbsp; All seems still too sudden so I will need to talk to my supervisors about this idea.&nbsp; However, I think it is time to do some networking at this moment.&nbsp; It is never too early.<br /><br />If I can make this trip, I cannot tell what the outcome is at present.&nbsp; I will make a more detailed plan if my supervisors give me a green.</div>
