I did some experiment with GPS Visualizer which I mentioned yesterday.  I used it to visualise some Landsat images that I can use for my research.<br/><br/><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="http://www.snakehsu.info/sigma_c/google_earth_screen.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.snakehsu.info/sigma_c/google_earth_screen.html','popup','width=792,height=713,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.snakehsu.info/sigma_c/2007/11/09/googleearth.jpg/google_earth_screen-thumb-400x360.jpg" width="400" height="360" alt="google_earth_screen.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></span><br/><br/>In this screenshot you can see three overlays generated from Landsat visual images provided by [Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/targetFamily/Earth).  If you take a closer look at places where these images overlap you will find that the quality of registration is very impressive.  However, GPS Visualizer seems not able to control the skewness of the image, all overlays are rectified to the latitude and longtitude, which is not the direction of Landsat's nadir path (shown in the image as a white line).  Anyway, using it I can get an idea of the satellite coverage of my study area (red box) without using complicated GIS/RS software packages.</div>
