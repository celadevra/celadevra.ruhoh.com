Yesterday I thought I made some sensible results from the model I am working on.  However, today I realised that the water head exceeding land surface is a kind of scenario: you have intact peat layers but no vegetation at all, thus no interception of moisture by plants, nor enhanced storage by <i>Sphagnum</i>.  Besides, I should assume a constant head layer below all layers so the precipitation can finally be received at this depth.  Though adding this layer do not change the flooding at the surface, I think this model illustrates the influence of topography -- some areas with high elevation will eventually go dry.<br/><br/>The most important thing for <i>Sphagnums</i>, cannot be found out at this layer.&nbsp; For them to grow, the peat layer must have water present.&nbsp; The critical problem thus is the water head in the acrotelm.&nbsp; Thus I made another model with only two layers: one acrotelm and one constant head (a reservoir) below it.&nbsp; The simulation shows how deep water draws down in different locations.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try tomorrow make it a transient model so I can observe the process. &nbsp;<br/><br/>At this moment I think I will forget about that model for one night and do something else for a change.&nbsp;</div>
