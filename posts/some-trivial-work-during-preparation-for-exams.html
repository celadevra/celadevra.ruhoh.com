Nothing quite exciting today.  Dr. Rieley recommended one PhD dissertation about vegetation in Derwent Valley.  But I think the map provided by this dissertation is a bit too coarse for my purpose.  At this stage I cannot use the map to identify Sphagnum patches from aerial photos because almost all 1km^2 grids on the map have certain kinds of Sphagnum.<br/><br/>I will need to contact Joe Holden in Leeds University for information on gully blocking.</div>
