This is [another environmental awareness movie](http://wip.warnerbros.com/11thhour/) made in the U. S. after [Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/).  Narrated by Hollywood actor and environmental   activist [Leonardo DiCaprio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/), The 11th Hour tries not only to raise awareness, but also to give suggestions on tackling the global warming problem.  The message being carried by the movie is that people should change their ways of lives to help save themselves from formidable global climate disaster.<br/><br/>The goal however, is not easy to achieve.  Asking Leo to do the narrator work is a nice consideration to raise people's interest.  However, it is the quality of persuation of the movie that determines to what extent will the current undesirable state be changed.  I will see if I can watch it myself in a cinema and continue the report.</div>
