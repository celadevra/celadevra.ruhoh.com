The other day my wife asked me about the reason why barbers all have a spinning pole with spiralling red and blue stripes on it outside their shops.  I could not give an answer.

While reading the Nov 17 issue of ??New Scientist?? today, I encountered the anecdote: back in the 18th century bloodletting was common for treating many kinds of ailments.  There was no surgeon at that time, and patients are often bled at the barber's.

Barber's Pole is a symbol of the history.  The pole itself is like the cylinder the patient holds when they need to make their vein pop up; the brass caps on both ends are a symbol of basins used to catch blood.  The blue and red stripes are imitating the bandages.  After the bandages are used, they are dried under the sun.  Losing moisture causes the cloth to curl up and form the spiral that we see on today's Poles.
