The curtain finally falls after two weeks of negotiation. Though the Independent critisized that there is too much more talk than action, from Friday night to Saturday night delegates from 157 countries finally made some progress in achieving an agreement on further reduction of GHG after 2012. In addition, the mechanism of compensating tropical forest conserving countries was also established in this conference. The total outcome seems not to be too bad.<br/><br/>The US still rejects the idea of global action to reduce carbon dioxide. They say they have spend $3bn on technologies that reduce emission and that was their effort. But Former President Mr. Clinton's speech apparently played a subtle role in the progress. This morning it is reported that US may have an agreement with other countries on further negotiation, after the impolite demostration of walking out the conference earlier yesterday.<br/><br/>This delegates also agreed on the scheme of auditing emission and a rule book making the Kyoto Protocal operational. The next step would be put all these into action. As Clinton said, 40 years later we could end up on a raft somewhere if we do nothing now.</div>
