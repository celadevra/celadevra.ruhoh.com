At this moment I am considering the questions to ask the local people when I am in the field.&nbsp; The originality of my research, compared to other studies in the area, is the assessment of resilience.&nbsp; The field visit will provide me with some information for resilience assessment that cannot be obtained from other places.&nbsp; This will involve the historical data, people's perception of events and policies, and actual practices.<br /><br />I may need to read more methodology about resilience analysis and design my questions accordingly.</div>
