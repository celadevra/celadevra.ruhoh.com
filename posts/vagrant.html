It was 12:00 at noon. I was in Tsinghua University's tenth mess hall waiting for one of my friends, who needs to share the fee card with me. I feel reluctant. I should have been here half an hour earlier and there will be less people.  If I just use my own card, I will just have my lunch alone. Yeah, why not? I can choose the time and place for any of my meals. Suddenly I find out a bit about why I can't be with my ex-girlfriend for a long enough time. I am a vagrant. I want to arrange my time myself. I don't want to wait for someone before I want to do something. Nor do I want anybody telling me &quot;it's time for this&quot; or &quot;it's time for that&quot; against my own decision and habitats.  Another people having every meal with me will soon or later make me mad. I have too much of my own business.  Don't tell me someone will change this. It will only change when I finally learn to be still one day. Not in the predictable future. I am glad that I didn't run into some people's lives before. They will not be hurt by me and my vagrant character now.  Sometimes I do feel alone. But at such times what I need is a spiritual companion more than one who eats with me. I don't like love and girlfriend being brought down to physical level.</div>
