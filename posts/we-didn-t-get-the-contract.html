In today's meeting, we, the NU Consultants, did not get the bid for the Peak District National Park Monitoring plan.<br/><br/>All people in the team have invested a lot in this project. Vicky contributed a lot of brilliant ideas, Jenny and Val worked hard to make the presentation attractive. I read a lot of backgrounds and did a lot of note taking.<br/><br/>But Livia's group got the 'check'. They won because their plan are more practical (though I don't think it is half as innovative as ours). We lost the bid maybe because that we had too little about budget.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Livia and her colleagues. We will try to fight back in the future.<br/><br/>Though it is not real bidding, but I won't say it is "just a simulation" because the winner won't say so, neither do I. Hopefully we will have a analysis of the performance this friday.</div>
