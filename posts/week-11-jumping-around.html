This week I had very little time on the review.&nbsp; Basically it was complete, only need a few patches here and there.&nbsp; I had to divert much time on other non-academic issues, including visa extension and graduation.&nbsp; On the Presentation Wednesday I found that I did very little on methodology, though the idea of the project was still attractive.<br /><br />Next phase would be filled by study of methodology and planning for fieldwork.</div>
