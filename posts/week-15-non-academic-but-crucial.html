<div class='post'>
This week's major activity is not very &quot;academic&quot;, I should say.&nbsp; I spent most of the time trying to find suitable fund providers and write a proposal that is persuading enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />The proposal was very different from the one I used to apply for the opportunity to study in my university.&nbsp; This time I had better considerations about the project, the methodology, outcomes, and possible limitations.&nbsp; Writing the proposal also made me think more about the practicality and other issues which may make the project better.<br /><br />The search for funding was not very rewarding, compared to the time and energy I invested in it.&nbsp; However when I was browsing through the grant maker's category, I realised that Chinese students have more potential funders than they know from their information sources.&nbsp; If I know this from the beginning....&nbsp; <br /><br />At the same time I realised that I need an ecological assessment to company my &quot;human geographical&quot; methods if I want to realise what I promised on my proposal.&nbsp; Considering the time and resources limit, I think I have to turn to either secondary data or some easy-to-use assessment method (is there any?).&nbsp; I need to persuade my supervisors to let me work on this topic.<br /><br />Now I feel I have a better grasp of what to expect in the field in April so I become a bit calmer.</div>
