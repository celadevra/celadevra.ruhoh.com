I would like to cut the money crap and mainly write down what I have done academically in this week (what's remaining? Let's see...).<br /><br />My supervisors always tell me that I should try to use some RS technologies to get a panorama of the area being studied, while observing with my own eyes the &quot;ground truths&quot; -- not only ground truth in RS terms, but also what cannot be observed from above -- how people actually interact with others and the environment.&nbsp; This is an attractive idea, I think.&nbsp; Among all possible sensors and images sources, my supervisor speaks highly of CORONA -- the KH series military satellite B/W photographs taken in 1960s and 1970s, which were declassified only a few years ago.&nbsp; My personal question about using this image source is that how I can use this to identify vegetation changes, as I cannot validate the result of interpretation (the ground truth only existed 40 years ago) and cannot tell what are grassland on the image.&nbsp; I have read some articles on the utilisation of CORONA images.&nbsp; It seems that texture of the image can be used in classification.&nbsp; Maybe if I can use them along with LANDSAT ETM images and ground observation I can get some high-resolution results.<br /><br />Bringing an interpreter to the field is not impossible but seems will not bring much benefit to my study, not counting the aid in communication.&nbsp; It should be considered as a last resort only.&nbsp; I am trying to learn some Tibetan myself though I cannot tell how much progress I can make before I set off to the field.&nbsp; But learning it is helpful anyway for anyone studying pastoralism.&nbsp;</div>
