First of all, I have to admit that I did not do much during the week.  I spent considerable time wrestling with Ruby on Rails, Mephisto and Typo, and strange \.htaccess files.  The writing on resilience has brought along some interesting questions, such as social vurnerability, ecosystem restoration, and perhaps equity, which I did not address enough in the writing.  However, I find myself pretty fed up after so much reading (on the same guys' articles).  I can only write one or two paragraph one day, just feel not like writing.<br/><br/>The other part of the work, preparation of the fieldwork, has some progress.  However, from time to time I feel it pressing.  There may be questions that I cannot solve here but can only tackle in China.  Therefore I decided that I should go back some days earlier so I can do something before May Day holiday.<br/><br/>Perhaps I need some fresh air, as well as some social activities, to diversify my life a bit.  Or there will be weariness and tedium.</div>
