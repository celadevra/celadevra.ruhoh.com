After I really go down to the work and made a series of plans and budgets, I find that planning an expedition is not so dreadful as I thought before.  There are still many uncertainties but apparently they will not prevent my plan from being carried out.<br/><br/>The contact with local government and researchers is going well.<br/><br/>But for a newbie in interviewing like me, I am not sure if my interview outline is as good as it should be.  I have so many questions to ask yet I find the question list already a bit long for a group interview.  I am also uncertain about the sequence of the questions.<br/><br/>The application for this year's Slawson award failed, which renders my fieldwork more costly.  I hope that I can get other funding later this year and next year.</div>
