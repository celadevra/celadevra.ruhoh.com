<div class='post'>
The last week passed without much writing.  It seems that most documents I need have been prepared.  The rest is to find what are needed and to patch these documents.<br/><br/>I have spent considerable time in revision of resilience concept.  The study of application of resilience in social vulnerability is a feasible direction to which my study can take.  However, does this make my study more complicated and exceed its original scope?  One thing is for sure: that to measure social vulnerability I cannot ignore ecological vulnerability.  In a resource-dependent society the two vulnerabilities are closed linked.</div>
