It is just one week before I set out to Beijing and Tibet.  This week is mainly about doing some small tasks that are relevant to the fieldwork.  On Tuesday I met my supervisors and it turns out that I need to change the way I ask certain interview questions.  They also suggest that I read more about interviews conducted in another language and culture as well as hybrid research.<br/><br/>I considered the problem of finding an interpreter who can accompany me all the way through the study.  I wonder if any college student can do this.  A more practical way may be seeking them through other research institutes or organisations.</div>
