Time goes past really quickly.<br /><br />I guess searching for articles for 12 hours per day is a bit too much.&nbsp; Besides, if I do not start writing I may never finish it.&nbsp; Therefore I just changed my strategy, write an outline first, then look for the relevant materials, one section per day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even so, all this work combined with reading assignments of other training programs is intimidating.&nbsp; I find it hard to keep critical on the materials I am reading after a long day of such activity.&nbsp; Fortunately, I am still progressing.&nbsp; I have already had a grip on Tibet's holocene climate.&nbsp; The next thing is the climate at present.&nbsp; Considering the diversity of climate types in Tibet, there is also considerable work load.&nbsp; But this will make a important base for my review and thesis.<br /><br />I do not know how much time I have on this part, but I think I must be patient in next few weeks.</div>
