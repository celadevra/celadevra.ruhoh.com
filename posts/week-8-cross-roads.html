The review on Tibetan environment is close to finish.&nbsp; The climate section is the most detailed.&nbsp; The other are less so.&nbsp; Given the availability of today's literatures on Tibet biomes and geology, I believe to write a more detailed version for the other parts will cost much more time than the current one.&nbsp; Another problem is that considerable amount of data are only accessible from China.<br /><br />I surely have more literature reviews to do in next weeks.&nbsp; However, I also realised that it may be the time I began preparation for the fieldwork.&nbsp; Some work may take longer than I expect, so an early start would be better.&nbsp; I have not talked about this with my supervisors, but I think they will agree with me on this.<br /><br />During the study of Tibetan ecology I find the system more complicated than I previously estimated.&nbsp; The dynamics of pikas is complicated enough.&nbsp; This may add some difficulties to future research, considering it is basically blank in ecological research in Tibet.</div>
