It is not easy to do a real interdisciplinary research, especially when you are all along and have less than 3 years' time.&nbsp; However, I do not think a purely human geographic study would be suitable for my study, or worth a PhD.&nbsp; I need to attempt an approach to integration of physical geography study in social-economic studies.<br /><br />A precondition to this is to find out what are the physical part in the study.&nbsp; For me it is something about ecology, maybe animal behaviour as well.&nbsp; However, it is still too wide and too vague.&nbsp; If I want to determine the resilience of the system, what environmental information do I need?&nbsp; To answer this question, I think, is to determine the physical part of my research.<br /><br />Such environmental information may include environmental impacts in terms of vegetation and land cover change, hydrology, soil and nutrient; environmental responses in terms of livestock population dynamics, recovery from disasters, and so on.&nbsp; Rebuilding environmental history will also involve physical geography methods such as laminate and glacial sediment analysis.<br /><br />How I get this physical information is another problem.&nbsp; It would be impractical to try to obtain detailed ecological information for every aspect of the grassland.&nbsp; Thus a study of which factors to consider and a scoping process are necessary before I go to the field.</div>
