This week's *Science* magazine published [an editorial](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/316/5821/17) by Rosina M. Bierbaum and Peter H. Raven.  This editorial promotes another effort to prevent reaching the tipping point of global climate change by urging the government and companies as well as individuals to take measures.  Different from IPCC, this new initiative is managed by the UN (see [http://www.unfoundation.org/SEG/](http://www.unfoundation.org/SEG/)).  Hopefully, the influence of UN will be more useful than IPCC, which can only ``suggest'' the governments but cannot ``urge'' them to act.<br/><br/>However, a group consist of purely scientists may have a problem, that their suggestions are often theoretically sound but politically too abstract or impractical.  Arguably, the suggestion made by the SEG suffers from the same problem.  If you want to give advice to all over the world, you have to be abstract.<br/><br/>I think the next step would be giving every country a ``recipe'', indicating the costs and benefits of every measure they mentioned, that is what politicians really care about.</div>
