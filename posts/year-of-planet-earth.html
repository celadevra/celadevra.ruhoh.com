This week's [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7176/) magazine has provided a chunky supplement under the title ``Year of Planet Earth'', discussing earth science topics relevant to global changes.  I have not got time to read all articles in this supplement, yet [this one](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7176/full/nature06590.html) I read is of high quality.  Its analysis of Westerlies is related to my current research.<br/><br/>2008 is the second year in the three consecutive years' span of International Year of Planet Earth.  The aim is to promote earth science studies and identify the role of earth sciences in the society.  More information can be found at [the year's website](http://www.yearofplanetearth.org/).</div>
